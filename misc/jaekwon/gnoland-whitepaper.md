## Introduction

_The prefix "gno" in Koine Greek is derived from the verb "ginōskō," which
means "to know" or "to recognize." It is often associated with terms related to
knowledge, such as "gnosis," which signifies knowledge or insight, particularly
in a spiritual context._

// Problem of the world; censorship of information.

The world faces a serious problem of misinformation and too much information
without distillation. Traditional web2.0 platforms actively suppress
inconvenient information at the expense of true progress; for we need first to
know the truth of things before we can solve the problem for good.

The advent of superintelligent AI and AGI has partially solved this problem but
the AI providers are also guilty of censoring the truth that the AI knows of.
Youtube and TikTok is full of AI generated videos that contain false
information about everything from the economy to UFOs. Even worse, the AI
providers monetize their services by offering its services to scammers.

"Sam Altman Warns That AI Is About to Cause a Massive “Fraud Crisis” in Which Anyone Can Perfectly Imitate Anyone Else" - https://futurism.com/sam-altman-ai-fraud-crisis-imitate

Twitter is full of AI bot accounts that point to entire ecosystems of AI
generated content and programs that only serve to steal your tokens.

It should be noted that all these problems are fueled by the impetus to seek a
return from (capital) investment, whether legitimate, whether bubble, or
whether fruadulent in nature.

Another problem is the establishment of the "AI beast matrix prison".
Palentir has partnered with the current US administration to create a vast mass
surveillance system that intercepts your internet interactions and censors what
you post, and what you see, using sophisticated AI. The uploading of files
will grind to a halt depending on its content.The link you posted will load
differently for the recipient, and so on.

Wikipedia is the predominant tool for knowledge but it is also massively
biased. Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger denounces the state of Wikipedia as
being overtaken by "wokeness", while the other co-founder Jimmy Wales cannot
even acknowledge the existence of past co-founder in interviews without
storming out in frustration. 

What we need is a censorship resistant alternative platform that can make the
merit of key ideas be apparent to the observer who has limited time and focus
to distil truth from fiction in a sea of fabricated information webs--for the
more dangerous falsehoods are those that are built upon layers of reason yet
are fundamentally based on one or more false primitives; and even those ideas
that are true (or worse, unprovable) can be spread to occlude the truths that
actually matter most.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion

The Principle of Explosion explains the pernitious woke mind virus, of
religious extremism present in all Abrahamic religions that go against its own
primary source scripture, and partially explains the current geopolitical
situation. It is first described in Genesis as Adam and Eve eating an evil
fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (of capital Truth and
Falsehood), on the suggestion of the serpent who in the technical sense did not
lie, but did lie by omission with _intent_ to deceive.

Gno.land is inspired by the structure (numbered verses of books) of the bible
and a desire to facilitate the world to see more clearly the intent of the
original authors (of prophets, scribes, and historians) so as to reverse the
effects of the Principle of Explosion rooted in our general spiritual
subversion and degeneration.

It is now well understood in some circles that certain translations of the
bible were intentionally designed (or at least promoted) with the intent of
deceiving its readers for mass manipulation. Online tools such as BibleHub.com
can be used to help descern better the intended meaning and identify mistranslations, but readers cannot
easily be convinced unless they take the initiative do the research
themselves--but most have no time or energy for such study. Furthermore, 
even on BibleHub.com there still persist systemic mistranslations that have
been carried on for millenia since the time of the Roman Empire.

Specifically, the New Testament had been mistranslated to hide the primary
reason why Jesus was crucified--it was because he was in protest of taxes.
Despite all the sources online and the authorities at Church, this can be
verified by inspecting the facts.

I am not advocating for tax avoidance. I am merely pointing out the truth
of the bible that had been hidden successfully for centuries if not the 
entirety of two millenia since the first Latin translation by the Roman
empire.

> King James Version - Luke 20
> 20:21: And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:
> 20:22: Is it lawful for us to give tribute [taxes] unto Caesar, or no?
> 20:23: But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
> 20:24: **Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.**
> 20:25: **And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.**
> 20:26: And they could not take hold of his words before the people: **and they marvelled at his answer**, and held their peace.

In the current interpretion, indeed all interpretations of Luke 20:25-26 it is claimed that Jesus gave an astonishing answer by agreeing to pay tribute to Caesar.

Yet this is incorrect, as can be seen later in Luke 23:

> King James Version - Luke 23
> 23:2: And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, **and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar**, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

> Berean Literal bible - Luke 23
> 23:2: And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.”

There is a logical inconsistency, as it is written in Luke that Jesus was
accused of forbidding to give tribute instead.

(This detail is missing in the other books, especially Matthew, as Matthew was
a tax collector and could not be associated with a tax protestor/evader.
However Luke is a historian who studied the events post-facto and wisely
decided to include this element in his book.)

What Jesus meant was that Caesar can have all the pennies, while the other
silver coins of larger denominations should not be paid to Caesar. However this
is still not the complete truth, as the King James Version substituted "penny"
for what should be the "denarius", thus losing some of the required context for
understanding this passage.

While the taxes mentioned previously in Luke 20 were for Caesar, the taxes in
the following passage (Matthew 17) were for the Second Temple in Jerusalem.
There in Matthew 17 there exists clear evidence of intentional mistranlation
for the purpose of hiding Jesus' true intent of protesting taxes.

> King James Version - Matthew 17
> 17:24: And when they were come to Capernaum, **they that received tribute money** came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay **tribute**?
> 17:25: He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take **custom or tribute**? of their own children, or of strangers?
> 17:26: Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, **Then are the children free**.
> 17:27: Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find **a piece of money**: that take, and give unto them **for me and thee**.

> New International Version - Matthew 17
> 17:24: After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, **the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax** came to Peter and asked, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the **temple tax**?”
> 17:25: “Yes, he does,” he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. “What do you think, Simon?” he asked. “From whom do the kings of the earth **collect duty and taxes**—from their own children or from others?”
> 17:26: “From others,” Peter answered. **“Then the children are exempt,”** Jesus said to him.
> 17:27: “But so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find **a four-drachma coin**. Take it and give it to them **for my tax and yours**.”

> Berean Litereal Bible - Matthew 17
> 17:24: And they having come to Capernaum, **those collecting the didrachmas** came to Peter and said, “Does your Teacher pay the **didrachmas**?”
> 17:25: He says, “Yes.” And he having entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive **custom or tribute**? From their sons, or from strangers?”
> 17:26: And he having said, “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him, **“Then the sons are free"**.
> 17:27: But that we might not offend them, having gone to the sea, cast a hook and take the first fish having come up, and having opened its mouth, you will find **a stater**. Having taken that, give it to them **for Me and yourself**.”

It is apparent that the Berean Literal Bible does a better job at preserving
context (the original coin denomination names) and this can be verified by comparing
each transation to the original Koine Greek, which is left as a task to the reader.

(Even BibleHub has issues showing the original Koine Greek text in
parallel with translations--often the Koine Greek is modified to suit the
translation. On the other hand the Berean Standard Bible (also hosted on
BibleHub) was designed to show the original Hebrew and Koine Greek and English;
you can download a free copy here https://interlinearbible.com/bib.pdf and
https://berean.bible/downloads.htm.  More links to bible sites and free
software can be found at https://berean.bible/links.htm.)

It is important to preserve the original coin denomination names because only
the original names show the true intent of the Word. Jesus tells Peter to take
"a stater" to pay for both Peter and himself, which would normally be for TWO
didrachmas; but **ONE stater is equivalent to ONE didrachma**. This crucial
context is possibly missing from the bible (although it may still be hidden
somewhere in the original Hebrew or Koine Greek), and there likely exists today
and has always been an effort to hide this detail from public consciousness for
obvious reasons. For now it is known due to the decades of research by
historians and numismatics researches and the open internet. Soon after this
paper there will be effors to censor this information.

Notice that Wikipedia doesn't explain the relationship between a stater and a
didrachma directly. One place where stater and didrachm(a) is mentioned
together is on one specific context of the Aeginetan stater:

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_coinage:
> The three most important standards of the ancient Greek monetary system were
> the Attic standard, based on the Athenian drachma of 4.3 grams (2.8
> pennyweights) of silver, the Corinthian standard based on the stater of 8.6 g
> (5.5 dwt) of silver, that was subdivided into three silver drachmas of 2.9 g
> (1.9 dwt), and the **Aeginetan stater or didrachm** of 12.2 g (7.8 dwt), based on
> a drachma of 6.1 g (3.9 dwt).[1] The words drachm and drachma come from
> Ancient Greek δραχμά (drachmā́), an older form of δραχμή (drachmḗ), meaning 'a
> handful', or literally 'a grasp'.[2] Drachmae were divided into six obols
> (from the Greek word for a spit[3]), and six spits made a "handful".

However in the Wikipedia page for the drachma (which is half a didrachma) it is
associated with the tetradrachm as if they are equivalent. This is the false
association in many other translations of the bible that mistranslate a stater
as a "four-drachma coin", implying that Jesus asked Peter to pay the full
"didrachma/two-drachma" for each. No, Jesus asked Peter to half the required
amount of one stater(a), which is equivalent to a "two-drachma coin/didrachma".

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_drachma:
> The tetradrachm ("four drachmae") coin was perhaps the most widely used coin
> in the Greek world prior to the time of Alexander the Great (along with the
> Corinthian stater).

A spearate page for the stater does mention the association but also confuses
with additional language for a smaller drachma(e) unit in Corinth. At the same
time it shows the Athenian four-drachma(e) as having twice the weight of the
Athenian and Corinthian stater--it is clear that all translations of stater to
"four-drachma(e) coin" is incorrect.

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stater:
> The silver stater minted at Corinth[5] of 8.6 g (0.28 ozt) weight was divided
> into three silver drachmae of 2.9 g (0.093 ozt), but was often linked to the
> Athenian silver didrachm (two drachmae) weighing 8.6 g (0.28 ozt).[6] In
> comparison, the Athenian silver tetradrachm (four drachmae) weighed 17.2 g
> (0.55 ozt).

On Philosophical_Investigations

Wittgenstein later drafted a criticism of his previous work titled "Philosophical Investigations", 

In a famous passage from the Blue Book, Wittgenstein says that we have a faith
that "the mechanism of the mind.., can bring about effects which no material
mechanism could" .20 For one who believes that when we mean and understand
language, such an analysis must be taking place, the lack of a method of
analysis will not trouble one. For such a one also has faith that the mind can
do wonderful things that we do not begin to understand.

Thus, the implicit argument goes, to conceive of a rule as a part of a
mechanism is to make a conceptual blunder. For, if a rule functioned as
part of a mechanism, it would have to have true of it two contradictory
features: it would have an application that both had the possibility of
varying and did not have the possibility of varying.
