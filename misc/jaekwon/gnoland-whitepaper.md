# Gno.land Whitepaper

## Introduction

_The prefix "gno" in Koine Greek is derived from the verb "ginōskō," which
means "to know" or "to recognize." It is often associated with terms related to
knowledge, such as "gnosis," which signifies knowledge or insight, particularly
in a spiritual context._

// Problem of the world; censorship of information.

The world faces a serious problem of misinformation and too much information
without distillation. Traditional web2.0 platforms actively suppress
inconvenient information at the expense of true progress; for we need first to
know the truth of things before we can solve the problem for good.

The advent of superintelligent AI and AGI has partially solved this problem but
the AI providers are also guilty of censoring the truth that the AI knows of.
Youtube and TikTok is full of AI generated videos that contain false
information about everything from the economy to UFOs. Even worse, the AI
providers monetize their services by offering its services to scammers.

"Sam Altman Warns That AI Is About to Cause a Massive “Fraud Crisis” in Which Anyone Can Perfectly Imitate Anyone Else" - https://futurism.com/sam-altman-ai-fraud-crisis-imitate

Twitter is full of AI bot accounts that point to entire ecosystems of AI
generated content and programs that only serve to steal your tokens.

It should be noted that all these problems are fueled by the impetus to seek a
return from (capital) investment, whether legitimate, whether bubble, or
whether fruadulent in nature.

Another problem is the establishment of the "AI beast matrix prison".
Palentir has partnered with the current US administration to create a vast mass
surveillance system that intercepts your internet interactions and censors what
you post, and what you see, using sophisticated AI. The uploading of files
will grind to a halt depending on its content.The link you posted will load
differently for the recipient, and so on.

Wikipedia is the predominant tool for knowledge but it is also massively
biased. Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger denounces the state of Wikipedia as
being overtaken by "wokeness", while the other co-founder Jimmy Wales cannot
even acknowledge the existence of past co-founder in interviews without
storming out in frustration. 

What we need is a censorship resistant alternative platform that can make the
merit of key ideas be apparent to the observer who has limited time and focus
to distil truth from fiction in a sea of fabricated information webs--for the
more dangerous falsehoods are those that are built upon layers of reason yet
are fundamentally based on one or more false primitives; and even those ideas
that are true (or worse, unprovable) can be spread to occlude the truths that
actually matter most.

> In classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and similar logical systems, the

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion

The Principle of Explosion explains the pernitious woke mind virus, of
religious extremism present in all Abrahamic religions that go against its own
primary source scripture, and partially explains the current geopolitical
situation. It is first described in Genesis as Adam and Eve eating an evil
fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (of capital Truth and
Falsehood), on the suggestion of the serpent who in the technical sense did not
lie, but did lie by omission with _intent_ to deceive.

Gno.land is inspired by the structure (numbered verses of books) of the bible
and a desire to facilitate the world to see more clearly the intent of the
original authors (of prophets, scribes, and historians) so as to reverse the
effects of the Principle of Explosion rooted in our general spiritual
subversion and degeneration.

## Use Cases

Open knowledgebase of propositional logic.

1. The world is everything that is the case.
2. What is the case (a fact) is the existence of states of affairs.
3. A logical picture of facts is a thought.
4. A thought is a proposition with a sense.
5. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)
6. The general form of a proposition is the general form of a truth function, which is: XXX This is the general form of a proposition.
7. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

The world is everything that is the case.[1]

1.1   The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
1.11  The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.
1.12  For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.
1.13  The facts in logical space are the world.
1.2   The world divides into facts.
1.21  Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.

On Philosophical_Investigations

Wittgenstein later drafted a criticism of his previous work titled "Philosophical Investigations", 

In a famous passage from the Blue Book, Wittgenstein says that we have a faith
that "the mechanism of the mind.., can bring about effects which no material
mechanism could" .20 For one who believes that when we mean and understand
language, such an analysis must be taking place, the lack of a method of
analysis will not trouble one. For such a one also has faith that the mind can
do wonderful things that we do not begin to understand.

Thus, the implicit argument goes, to conceive of a rule as a part of a
mechanism is to make a conceptual blunder. For, if a rule functioned as
part of a mechanism, it would have to have true of it two contradictory
features: it would have an application that both had the possibility of
varying and did not have the possibility of varying.

// Open knowledgebase of propositional logic of political problems.

Nuno Loureiro was assassinated yesterday.

He was a professor + the director of MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center

> 47 years old
> Studied nuclear fusion (= energy source of the Sun + stars) for 10 years at MIT
> His award-winning work focused on creating a virtually limitless, clean energy source on Earth - one that doesn’t produce carbon or radioactive waste (usual biproduct of fission reactors)
> His research was essentially a threat to companies in the energy sector (fossil fuels, wind, solar, etc)
> Nuno was vital to the development of fusion nuclear power plants, without him the path ahead is less clear + his death will set back the entire field

Nuno is not the first MIT fusion scientist to be brutally murdered, in 2004 Eugene Mallove was also shot in his home.

I hope this opens eyes – there is an agenda at play.
