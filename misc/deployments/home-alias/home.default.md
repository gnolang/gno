# Welcome to Gno.land

We're building Gno.land, set to become the leading open-source smart contract
platform, using Gno, an interpreted and fully deterministic variation of the
Go programming language for succinct and composable smart contracts.

With transparent and timeless code, Gno.land is the next generation of smart
contract platforms, serving as the "GitHub" of the ecosystem, with realms built
using fully transparent, auditable code that anyone can inspect and reuse.

Intuitive and easy to use, Gno.land lowers the barrier to web3 and makes
censorship-resistant platforms accessible to everyone. If you want to help lay
the foundations of a fairer and freer world, join us today.
