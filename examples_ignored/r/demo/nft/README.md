NFT's are all the rage these days, for various reasons.

I read over EIP-721 which appears to be the de-facto NFT standard on Ethereum. Then, made a sample implementation of EIP-721 (let's here called GRC-721). The implementation isn't complete, but it demonstrates the main functionality.

- [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)
- [gno.land/r/demo/nft/nft.go](https://gno.land/r/demo/nft/nft.go)

In short, this demonstrates how to implement Ethereum contract interfaces in gno.land; by using only standard Go language features.

Please leave a comment ([guide](https://gno.land/r/demo/boards:gnolang/1)).
