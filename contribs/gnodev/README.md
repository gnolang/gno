# `gnodev`: Your Gno Development Companion

`gnodev` is a robust tool designed to streamline your Gno package development process, enhancing productivity
by providing immediate feedback on code changes.

Please note that this is a quick overview. For a more detailed guide, refer to the official documentation at
[docs/builders/local-dev-with-gnodev.md](../../docs/builders/local-dev-with-gnodev.md).

## Synopsis

**gnodev** [**options**] [**PKG_PATH ...**]

## Features
-  **In-Memory Node**: Gnodev starts an in-memory node, automatically loading the **examples** folder and any
   user-specified paths.
-  **Web Interface Server**: Gnodev starts a `gnoweb` server on [`localhost:8888`](https://localhost:8888).
-  **Balances and Keybase Customization**: Set account balances, load them from a file, or add new accounts via a flag.
-  **Hot Reload**: Monitors the **examples** folder and specified directories for file changes, reloading the
   package and automatically restarting the node as needed.
-  **State Maintenance**: Ensures the previous node state is preserved by replaying all transactions.
-  **Transaction Manipulation**: Allows for interactive cancellation and redoing of transactions.
-  **State Export**: Export the current state at any time in a genesis doc format.

## Commands
While `gnodev` is running, trigger specific actions by pressing the following combinations:
-  **H**: Display help information.
-  **A**: Display account balances.
-  **R**: Reload the node manually.
-  **P**: Cancel the last action.
-  **N**: Redo the last cancelled action.
-  **Ctrl+S**: Save the current state.
-  **Ctrl+R**: Restore the saved state.
-  **E**: Export the current state to a genesis file.
-  **Cmd+R**: Reset the current node state.
-  **Cmd+C**: Exit `gnodev`.

## Usage
Run `gnodev` followed by any specific options and/or package paths. The **examples** directory is loaded
automatically. Use `--minimal` to prevent this.

Example:
```
gnodev --add-account <bech32/name1>[:<amount1>] ./myrealm
```

### `gnodev -h`
[embedmd]:# (.tmp/gnodev-usage.txt)
```txt
USAGE
  gnodev <cmd> [flags] 

The gnodev command starts an in-memory node and a gno.land
web interface, primarily for realm package development.

Currently gnodev comes with two mode <local> and <staging>, those command mostly
differ by there default values, while gnodev local as default for working
locally, satging default are oriented to be use on server.

gnodev uses its own package loader and resolver system to support multiple
scenarios and use cases. It currently supports three types of resolvers, each
taking a location as an argument.
- root: This resolver takes a <dir> as its location. It attempts to resolve
  packages based on your file system structure and the package path.
  For example, if 'root=/user/gnome/myproject' and you try to resolve
  'gno.land/r/bar/buzz' as a package, the <root> resolver will attempt to
  resolve it to /user/gnome/myproject/gno.land/r/bar/buzz.
- local: This resolver also takes a <dir> as its location. It is designed to
  load a single package, using the module name from 'gnomod.toml' within this
  package to resolve the package.
- remote: This resolver takes a <remote> RPC address as its location. It is
  meant to use a remote node as a resolver, primarily for testing a local
  package against a remote node.

Resolvers can be chained, and gnodev will attempt to use them in the order they
are declared.

For example:
    gnodev -resolver root=/user/gnome/myproject -resolver remote=https://rpc.gno.lands

If no resolvers can resolve a given package path, the loader will return a
"package not found" error.

If no command is provided, gnodev will automatically start in <local> mode.

For more information and flags usage description, use 'gnodev local -h'.

SUBCOMMANDS
  local    Start gnodev in local development mode (default)
  staging  Start gnodev in staging mode

```

### `gnodev local -h`
[embedmd]:# (.tmp/gnodev-local-usage.txt)
```txt
USAGE
  gnodev local [flags] [package_dir...]

LOCAL: Local mode configures the node for local development usage.
This mode is optimized for realm development, providing an interactive and flexible environment.
It enables features such as interactive mode, unsafe API access for testing, and lazy loading to improve performance.
The log format is set to console for easier readability, and the web interface is accessible locally, making it ideal for iterative development and testing.

By default, the current directory and the "example" folder from "gnoroot" will be used as the root resolver.

### `gnodev staging -h`
[embedmd]:# (.tmp/gnodev-staging-usage.txt)
```txt
USAGE
  gnodev staging [flags] [package_dir...]

STAGING: Staging mode configures the node for server usage.
This mode is designed for stability and security, suitable for pre-deployment testing.
Interactive mode and unsafe API access are disabled to ensure a secure environment.
The log format is set to JSON, facilitating integration with logging systems.
Since lazy-load is disabled in this mode, the entire example folder from "gnoroot" is loaded by default.

Additionally, you can specify an additional package directory to load.

```

### Transaction file format

`gnodev` can sends genesis transactions to the local node using the `-txs-file` flag associated with the `-paths` and the `-add-account` flag.

The transactions file attached to the `-txs-file` is a set of transaction, each wrapped by `"tx"`. A transaction can be generated by following the step 1, 2 and 3 from [Making an airgapped transaction](https://docs.gno.land/users/interact-with-gnokey/#making-an-airgapped-transaction).
Here's an example of the format:
```
{"tx": {"msg":[{"@type":"/vm.m_call","caller":"g1us8428u2a5satrlxzagqqa5m6vmuze025anjlj","send":"1000000ugnot","pkg_path":"gno.land/r/gnoland/users/v1","func":"Register","args":["administrator123"]}],"fee":{"gas_wanted":"2000000","gas_fee":"1000000ugnot"},"signatures":[{"pub_key":{"@type":"/tm.PubKeySecp256k1","value":"AmG6kzznyo1uNqWPAYU6wDpsmzQKDaEOrVRaZ08vOyX0"},"signature":""}],"memo":""}}
