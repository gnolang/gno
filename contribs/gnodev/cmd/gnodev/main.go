			Name:       "gnodev",
			ShortUsage: "gnodev <cmd> [flags] ",
			ShortHelp:  "Runs an in-memory node and gno.land web server for development purposes.",
			LongHelp: `The gnodev command starts an in-memory node and a gno.land web interface, primarily for realm package development.

Currently gnodev comes with two mode <local> and <staging>, those command mostly differ by there default values, while gnodev local as default for working locally, satging default are oriented to be use on server.

gnodev uses its own package loader and resolver system to support multiple scenarios and use cases. It currently supports three types of resolvers, each taking a location as an argument.
- root: This resolver takes a <dir> as its location. It attempts to resolve packages based on your file system structure and the package path. For example, if 'root=/user/gnome/myproject' and you try to resolve 'gno.land/r/bar/buzz' as a package, the <root> resolver will attempt to resolve it to /user/gnome/myproject/gno.land/r/bar/buzz.
- local: This resolver also takes a <dir> as its location. It is designed to load a single package, using the module name from 'gno.mod' within this package to resolve the package.
- remote: This resolver takes a <remote> RPC address as its location. It is meant to use a remote node as a resolver, primarily for testing a local package against a remote node.

Resolvers can be chained, and gnodev will attempt to use them in the order they are declared.

For example:
    gnodev -resolver root=/user/gnome/myproject -resolver remote=https://rpc.gno.lands

If no resolvers can resolve a given package path, the loader will return a "package not found" error.

If no command is provided, gnodev will automatically start in <local> mode.

For more information and flags usage description, use 'gnodev local -h'.`,
