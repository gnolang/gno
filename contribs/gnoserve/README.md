## `gnoserve`: Markdown Extensions for Gno.land

Interactive Extensions for gnodev Markdown Rendering

###  Motivation

We want to push Markdown beyond static text — without losing its simplicity.
By extending gnodev's rendering engine, we enable interactive models, visual editors,
and programmable UIs to live directly inside realm Markdown.

This lets Gno developers:

Keep content readable and versionable in plain text

Embed interactive logic models (e.g., Petri nets, grids, sprites)

Preview and test rich simulations without leaving the realm

⚙️ Code-as-content meets content-as-interface.
