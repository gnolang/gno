# Gno Contribs

This directory houses additional commands and tools designed to enhance your Gno experience.
These tools can range from simple wrappers for `gno`, `gnoland`, and `gnokey` to complete applications.
Some may be Go binaries with their own `go.mod` files, allowing the use of specialized libraries,
while others may be shell scripts or programs written in different languages.

## Contributing Guidelines

If you'd like to contribute a tool to Gno Contribs, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Naming**: Choose a clear and concise name for your tool, starting with one of the prefixes: `gno`, `gnoland`, or `gnokey`,
   followed by a short descriptive word or abbreviation.
   This naming convention helps users identify the purpose of the tool easily.
  
2. **User-Friendly**: Ensure that your tool is user-friendly and follows a similar style to other Gno tools,
   providing a consistent experience for users.
