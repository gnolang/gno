# Gno Doctest: Easy Code Execution and Testing

Gno Doctest is a tool that allows you to easily execute and test code blocks written in the Gno language. This tool offers a range of features, from simple code execution to complex package imports.

## 1. Basic Code Execution

Even the simplest form of code block can be easily executed.

```go
package main

func main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}

// Output:
// Hello, World!
```

Doctest also recognizes that a block of code is a gno. The code below outputs the same result as the example above.

```go
// @test: print hello world
package main

func main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Running this code will output "Hello, World!".

## 2. Using Standard Library Packages

Gno Doctest automatically recognizes and imports standard library packages.

```go
package main

import "std"

func main() {
    addr := std.GetOrigCaller()
    println(addr)
}
```

## 3. Utilizing Various Standard Libraries

You can use multiple standard libraries simultaneously.

```gno
package main

import "strings"

func main() {
    println(strings.ToUpper("Hello, World"))
}
```

This example uses the ToUpper() function from the strings package to convert a string to uppercase.

## 4. Automatic Package Import

One of the most powerful features of Gno Doctest is its ability to handle package declarations and imports automatically.

```go
func main() {
    println(math.Pi)
    println(strings.ToUpper("Hello, World"))
}
```

In this code, the math and strings packages are not explicitly imported, but Doctest automatically recognizes and imports the necessary packages.

## 5. Omitting Package Declaration

Doctest can even handle cases where the package main declaration is omitted.

```go
func main() {
    s := strings.ToUpper("Hello, World")
    println(s)
}

// Output:
// HELLO, WORLD
```

This code runs normally without package declaration or import statements.
Using Gno Doctest makes code execution and testing much more convenient.

You can quickly run various Gno code snippets and check the results without complex setups.
