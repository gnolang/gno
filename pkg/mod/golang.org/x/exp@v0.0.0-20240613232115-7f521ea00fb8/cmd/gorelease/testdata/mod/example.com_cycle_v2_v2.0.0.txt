# Note: "go get -d ." will add another example.com/cycle/v2 line. That line is
# non-deterministic, since the module is generate by prepareLoadDir each time.
# However, gorelease should ignore new go.sum entries for the module it's
# testing, since the requirement on that module is fake (a simulation: the user
# isn't actually relying on their own module).
