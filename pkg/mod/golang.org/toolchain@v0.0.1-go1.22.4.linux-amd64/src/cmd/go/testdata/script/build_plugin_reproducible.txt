# This test has problems when run on the LUCI darwin longtest builder,
# which uses a more contemporary Xcode version that is unfriendly to
# reproducible builds (see issue #64947 for the gory details). Note
# that individual developers running "go test cmd/go" on Darwin may
# still run into failures depending on their Xcode version.
