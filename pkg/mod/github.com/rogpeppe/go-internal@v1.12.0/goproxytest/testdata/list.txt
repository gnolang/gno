# On Go 1.18 and later, this will error out if GOPATH is ${WORK}/gopath,
# as that places GOMODCACHE inside the Go module and "mod tidy" walks it.
# "mod tidy" then complains about invalid import paths such as
# "mod/gopath/pkg/mod/fruit.com@v1.1.0/fruit".
# It's for that reason that we moved the default GOPATH to ${WORK}/.gopath.
