## Summary
- add `gno test -cover` flag plumbing and print coverage summary per package in go-test style
- add VM-level statement coverage collector and execution hit marking with low overhead when disabled
- integrate coverage tracking into `gnovm/pkg/test` for package tests and filetests
- add testscript coverage assertion for `-cover`
- wire CI `template_gnotest` to run with `-cover` and add `gnovm/tests` gnotest job

## Notes
- coverage is tracked for non-test package statements and reported as `coverage: X.Y% of statements`
- references #1121
