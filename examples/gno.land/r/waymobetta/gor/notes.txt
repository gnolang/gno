notes

todo:
* remove PR struct update values from fetch() and move into its own function
* replace math_things() with actual initial calculation algorithm
* refactor categories/subcategories to follow similar data structure as thresholds dictionary
* create new values for limits + weights of categories/subcategories/thresholds; likely votable but initially hardcoded by team
* update reward() to include a token mint/distribution
* create mapping between github username + gno account
* add message (pr comment) about notice of impending evaluation DAO ruling so user knows there is more to come

questions:
- will `panic()` crash a node or revert tx; otherwise, what is a safe operation that should be used to ensure a transaction gets reverted?
