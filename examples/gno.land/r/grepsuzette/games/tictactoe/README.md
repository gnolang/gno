## How the hell did Cap'n Cluck learn to play?

I, Cap'n Cluck, had to learn from the most cunning and crafty of creatures â€“ humans! I observed those barnacle-brained bilge-rats engaged in their most awesome game o' strategies, tic-tac-toe.

Through earhole-peepin', I picked up the patterns and strategies. I honed me beak on pieces o' eight, developin' a near-nautical sense o' spatial relationships! Aarrr, soon enough, I, Cap'n Cluck, became a veritable menace, matchin' wits with any landlubber brave enough to engage in a spot o' tic-tac-toe!
