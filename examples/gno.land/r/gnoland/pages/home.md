# Welcome to Gno.land
*Where governance is fair, development is open, and innovation is incentivized*

Version 1: Entry Text Box
Gno.land is a smart contract platform built for Gno, a deterministic implementation of Go, designed for secure, auditable, and reusable decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike historical blockchain development languages, Gno allows Go developers to easily transfer their skills without needing to learn a completely new language. With type safety and composability, Gno.land makes building scalable dApps secure, intuitive and reusable.

At its core, Gno.land is the ‘GitHub’ of the Gno ecosystem, where transparent, open-source smart contracts are built on top of a native censorship-resistant multi-user language based operating system (GnoOS), using the language Gno, and the Gno Virtual Machine (GnoVM) as the foundational layers.

Version 2: Entry Text Box

Gno.land is the first smart contract platform built on a multi-user, language-based operating system. Powered by Gno, a deterministic, interpreted version of Go, gno.land enables secure, reusable, and auditable decentralized applications (dApps). Developers can use familiar Go-like syntax to build modular smart contracts, enabling faster development and innovation.

At its core, Gno.land is more than a blockchain—it's an open, censorship-resistant OS for digital citizens and communities to use the web in the way it was supposed to work, free of centralized powers, freedom of communication, the freedom to own your content, and the freedom to self organize. 

## Key Features of Gno

Version !:

- Open & Transparent: All applications are open-source and fully auditable.
- Composable: Smart contracts are modular, reusable, and customizable to ease development and extend the ecosystem’s capabilities quickly.
- Censorship-Resistant: Enables platforms with fair moderation and freedom of communication without a central authority.
- Developer-Friendly: Intuitive design that reduces onboarding timelines and enables faster iteration.
- Go-Based & Type Safe: Go developers can transition seamlessly to Gno thanks to the well-established Go language, while benefiting from type safety for security.


Version 2

- Language-Based OS: The Gno Operating System (GnoOS) allows multi-user interaction at the protocol level where collaborative code, users, and governance all live together in the same system.
- Composable Smart Contracts: Build modular, reusable logic that scales across apps and use cases.
- Auditable & Open: All code is transparent and community-verifiable.
- Freedom by Design: Censorship-resistant, forkable architecture with fair moderation tools.
- Go-Compatible: Go developers can transition instantly

Use Cases

## Why Gno and Gno.land?

Gno.land’s smart contract platform is a first step in an experiment to build the full GnoOS to bypass the centralized and controlled restrictions of the current Web, and power new social platforms, governance frameworks, and economic models that favor contribution-based incentives.

Builders

## Build on Gno.land

Gnome builders are the citizens, stewards and cultivators of Gno.land. The applications and infrastructure built today are laying the technical foundations of the future Internet, Web7. A web that is powered by an open, and accessible multi-user language based operating system compatible with a new era of collaboration, communication, and coordination.
