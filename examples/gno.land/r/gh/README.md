# GitHub Realm

**Disclaimer**: This realm is not designed to automatically score or rank pull
requests. Its primary purpose is to provide factual, reliable data from GitHub
to the on-chain environment. Any interpretation or scoring of this data should
be handled by other systems or contracts.

Welcome to the GitHub realm. This suite of contracts is designed to bridge the
gap between GitHub's vast repositories of data and our on-chain environment. The
overarching aim is to translate select GitHub metrics and interactions onto the
blockchain, providing a seamless interface between the two ecosystems.

## Purpose of the Package

The main goals of this package are as follows:

1. **Oracle-Filled Data**: The package will primarily be populated by an oracle
   that translates and mirrors select GitHub data onto the chain. This ensures a
   reliable and consistent flow of data between GitHub and our on-chain
   ecosystem.

2. **User Account Linkage**: Users can establish a connection between their
   GitHub accounts and their on-chain identities, strengthening the bond between
   off-chain activities and on-chain representations.

3. **Helper Functions for Gno Contract Integration**: A series of helper
   functions will be available to convert GitHub objects into Gno objects. This
   will enable other contracts to seamlessly utilize GitHub data within their
   logic and operations.

## Key Features

### On-Chain Representation of GitHub Metrics

GitHub is a treasure trove of valuable metrics. This package will mirror
essential GitHub data on-chain, like issues, PR statuses, and more. The goal is
to provide an on-chain management system that reflects GitHub's activities,
ensuring the two platforms remain interlinked.

### Bidirectional Data Flow

While our primary focus is to mirror GitHub activities on-chain, the reverse
process is also integral. On-chain activities should be recognizable on GitHub,
allowing for a holistic data flow between the two systems.

### User Account Linkage

To bolster user interaction and maintain a reliable data flow, users can link
their GitHub and on-chain accounts. This bi-directional linkage offers users a
cohesive experience, and broadens our spectrum of interactivity.

### Helper Functions

Developers can tap into a range of helper functions, which can transform GitHub
data into Gno-compatible objects. This aids in integrating GitHub's vast
datasets into other on-chain contracts and logics.

## Conclusion

The GitHub package for Gno is a pioneering step towards integrating off-chain
data sources with on-chain functionalities. As we evolve this package, we remain
committed to maintaining the integrity of data, ensuring fairness, and enhancing
the user experience. Feedback, contributions, and suggestions are always
welcome!
