# `x/` Experimentation Area

Welcome to the `x/` directory, designed for experimentation.

Code in this area is less reviewed and more subject to change or break over
time. It's a great place to publish experiments and proposals for significant
challenges before they become an MVP and move to another directory.

While publishing code here provides core developers with more examples and edge
cases to work on through CI, consider alternative options such as working on
other repositories, keeping your work in a pull request, or exploring
[https://github.com/gnolang/hackerspace](https://github.com/gnolang/hackerspace)
for broader visibility and collaboration within the Gno community.

Exercise caution as code in this directory may be less stable or secure due to
its experimental nature.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to the exciting developments
happening in the `x/` directory. Together, we can shape the future of GnoVM.
