# Design choices

At this point

* mailbox automatically and freely created on both sides when a mail is sent.
* sender needs to pay stamps, they would go to the realm which will be managed by a DAO to finance new tool
* mails are unencrypted

I assume people would actually not mind paying for stamps if price is reasonnable. 
for example it was atom, at 1atom=12usd, I would be okay to pay 0.25$=0.02atom per 
mail sent (The time spent redacting a mail costs more than the stamps; and
it would feel less of a waste when I click the button if it costed money).

Do we still need an admin? Yes. Maybe see p/acl
Is it a public service? I think it can be a DAO. So semi-public?

Encryption is a huge topic for GNO and not possible at the moment.

## Various possible ideas

[ ] TUI - there is nothing in a Render() now
[ ] should be able to respond to mails.

Mail attachment:

  * Would be nice to attach NFTs, 
  * payment, 
  * to be able to sign (I mean "agree contractually" here) an other mail.


IMO The system could easily be envisionned to sit on a bigger system, persistent 
point-to-point messaging with mails being one particular type of message.
E.g. a very light mail dapp on top of a more universal solution, that can they be
used for releases, DAO orders and so on.
