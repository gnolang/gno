This is a very specific app.

But the app could also be envisionned to sit on a system instead.
If mail is a particular type of message, and a mail dapp is a user 
of a more universal messaging thing, then it brings some advantages.

This mail app would then take just a few lines.
And it would change the way we do things.

For example, orders in p/demo/releases, DAO orders and so on could be other kind of
messages. This way, it would be possible to search and have generic tools that
operate on all point-to-point messages without reimplementing everything all
the time. 

You could search inside the release notes emitted by a certain user,
during a certain year. Or searching at the orders emitted by a DAO that contain
a certain text. You could watch for a certain filter on a certain type of
message coming from some organization. (While this can end-up being costly, we
can imagine ways it can be made profitable, or growth-sustainable, instead)

Therefore it would be possible to realize more interoperable systems.

But not all point-to-point system have the same requirements. 
Some are producer-consumer, some are archive systems with a certain retention.
Meaning a certain amount of configuration is required for the dapps.

So it's a complex but interesting question.
