# Manfred's Personal Realms on gno.land

## Introduction

Welcome to the root directory of Manfred's personal realms on `gno.land`. Each
realm within this directory serves a specific purpose and offers a glimpse into
Manfred's interests, projects, and more.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a very early iteration and is subject to change frequently. The
structure and content of these realms are still in the experimental phase. The
concept was inspired by Jae Kwon's idea to manage his to-do list in
`jaekwon/home`. If you're using or referencing these realms, be prepared for
regular updates and modifications.

## Structure

- `manfred/home`: This is the main realm where Manfred lists items and topics of
  interest to him.
  `manfred/config`: Configuration used by other realms.
- `manfred/...`: Coming soon.

## Usage

Each realm can be accessed and interacted with individually. Typically, realms
implement a `Render()` function which presents the main content or functionality
of that realm.

## Access Control

All realms in this directory have a built-in security check to ensure that only
Manfred can interact with the contents in a meaningful way. Unauthorized access
attempts might be able to see the content but will not be able to make
modifications or access certain functionalities.

## Contributions & Collaboration

These realms are personal by nature. If you've stumbled upon them and have
suggestions or want to collaborate on a particular topic, please reach out
directly to Manfred.
