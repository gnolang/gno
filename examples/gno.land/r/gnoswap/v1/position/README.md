# Position

## Overview

**Position** is a GRC721 NFT (non-fungible token) that represents a liquidity provider's (LP's) unique liquidity position in GnoSwap. Unlike fungible liquidity shares, each position is distinct and tied to specific parameters, making it non-fungible.

## Key Features

- **Minting**: Users can create a new position by providing liquidity within a specific price range.
- **Liquidity Management**: Liquidity within a position can be increased or decreased.
- **Fee Collection**: Trading fees generated by the position can be collected.
- **Repositioning**: The price range of an existing position can be adjusted.
- **Non-Fungible Representation**: Each position is uniquely represented as an NFT with specific attributes.

## Position Properties

Each **Position** stores essential information, such as:
- **Owner Address**: The wallet address of the LP who owns the position.
- **Price Range**: Defined by upper and lower tick values.
- **Liquidity Amount**: The quantity of liquidity allocated to the position.
- **Accumulated Fees**: Earned fees from trading activity within the pool.

## Liquidity Merging Mechanism

Within the same pool, positions that share overlapping price ranges have their liquidity merged within the same tick. This structure enhances capital efficiency and allows LPs to exercise greater control over their liquidity allocation.
