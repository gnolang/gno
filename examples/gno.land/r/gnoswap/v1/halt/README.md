# Halt

## Overview

The halt contract uses the core framwork in the [halt package](../../../p/gnoswap/halt/README.md).

## For Beta Mainnet

The protocol will be initially deployed in `MainnetSafeMode`, which disables the withdrawal function during the beta mainnet period for safety reasons. The withdrawal function will be enabled by governance once the stability of the network is confirmed.
