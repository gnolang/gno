# Fixed size signed 256-bit math library

1. This is a library specialized at replacing the big.Int library for math based on signed 256-bit types.
2. It uses [uint256](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/examples/gno.land/p/demo/uint256) as the underlying type.

ported from [mempooler/int256](https://github.com/mempooler/int256)
