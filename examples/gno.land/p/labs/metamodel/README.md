# Metamodel Codex (v0)

*A terse map of the falsifiable web of meaning.*

## 0. Preamble
The Logoverse is not a platform, not a chain, not a protocol.  
It is the **substrate where logic and meaning become falsifiable**.  
Every model is cryptographically sealed; every connection is compositional truth.  

𒃲𒆕

## 1. Cryptographic Bedrock
- Each model is hashed into a CID.  
- Change any part of the structure the seal breaks.  
- Valid or void. No middle ground.  

𒉿𒀀

## 2. Petri-Net Grammar
- **Places** hold state.  
- **Transitions** enact change.  
- **Arcs** bind them into flows.  
- This is the native language of the Logoverse.

## 3. Falsifiability as Law
- Claims survive only if they can be disproven.  
- A model is accepted when it fits *exactly*.  
- Truth is a structural property, not a declaration.

## 4. Compositional Cosmos
- Models compose like cospans and wiring diagrams.  
- $objects are ports—bridges between worlds.  
- The ecosystem grows by assembly, not fiat.

## 5. Semantic Gravity
- Meaning clusters around structure.  
- Loose symbols drift away.  
- Verified forms attract, cohere, and persist.

## 6. Ecosystem of Objects
- Wallets, tokens, ideas, events—all modeled as $objects.  
- Each is portable, composable, falsifiable.  
- $object links stitch the Logoverse together.

## 7. Append-Only Evolution
- No deletion. No revisionist history.  
- Growth is layering: strata of models, proofs, glyphs.  
- The Logoverse accretes like geological time.

## 8. Resilient Substrate
- Designed to withstand corruption.  
- Resistant to attack through its structure, not decree.  
- A living lattice, surviving by construction.
