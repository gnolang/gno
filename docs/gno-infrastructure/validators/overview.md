# Validator Overview

## Introduction

Gno.land is a blockchain powered by the Gno tech stack, which consists of
the [Gno Language](https://docs.gno.land/concepts/gno-language/) (Gno),
[Tendermint2](https://docs.gno.land/concepts/tendermint2/) (TM2),
and [GnoVM](https://docs.gno.land/concepts/gnovm/). Unlike
existing [Proof of Stake](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/staking/) (PoS) blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem,
gno.land runs on [Proof of Contribution](https://docs.gno.land/concepts/proof-of-contribution/) (PoC), a novel
reputation-based consensus mechanism that values expertise and alignment with the project. In PoC, validators are
selected via governance based on their contribution to the project and technical proficiency. The voting power of the
network is equally distributed across all validators to achieve a high nakamoto coefficient. A portion of all
transaction fees paid to the network are evenly shared between all validators to provide a fair incentive structure.

| **Blockchain**                       | Cosmos                  | Gno.land                      |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Consensus Protocol**               | Comet BFT               | Tendermint2                   |
| **Consensus Mechanism**              | Proof of Stake          | Proof of Contribution         |
| **Requirement**                      | Delegation of Stake     | Contribution                  |
| **Voting Power Reward Distribution** | Capital-based           | Evenly-distributed            |
| **Number of Validators**             | 180                     | 20~200 (gradually increasing) |
| **Virtual Machine**                  | N/A                     | GnoVM                         |
| **Tokenomics**                       | Inflationary (Dilutive) | Deflationary (Non-dilutive)   |

## Hardware Requirements

The following minimum hardware requirements are recommended for running a validator node.

- Memory: 16 GB RAM (Recommended: 32 GB)
- CPU: 2 cores (Recommended: 4 cores)
- Disk: 100 GB SSD (Depends on the level of pruning)

:::warning

These hardware requirements are currently approximate based on the Cosmos validator specifications. Final requirements
will be determined following thorough testing and optimization experiments in Testnet 4.

## Good Validators

Validators for gno.land are trusted to demonstrate professionalism and responsibility. Below are best practices that can
be expected from a good, reliable validator.

#### Ecosystem Contribution

- Contributing to the core development of the gno.land project
- Providing useful tools or infrastructure services (wallets, explorers, public RPCs, etc.)
- Creating educational materials to guide new members
- Localizing documentation or content to lower language or cultural barriers

#### Quality Infrastructure

- Strong connectivity, CPU, and memory setup
- Exercising technical stability by retaining a high uptime with a robust monitoring system
- Robust contingency plans with failover systems, storage backups, and redundant power supplies
- Geographical distribution of servers

#### Transparency

- Providing regular updates
- Engaging actively in community discussions
- Being accountable for any failures

#### Compliance

- Exercising legal compliance
- Consulting with legal experts to identify regulatory risks
- Conducting internal audits

:::info

The validator set implementation in gno.land is abstracted away from the consensus mechanism inside the `r/sys/vals`
realm. The realm is not production ready yet, and is still under active development. Proposals and contributions to
improve and complete the implementation are welcome.
