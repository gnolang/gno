For this speech, and for daring to challenge the petro-dollar, and by the
cunning of Kissinger against Assad, Gaddafi was murdered in the streets.
Emphasis my own.  I don't claim that all of this speech is true; only that
truth eventually prevails.

# Statement of Muammar Al Gaddafi at the General Assembly of the United Nations

01.10.2009 - In the name of the African Union, I would like to greet the
members of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and I hope that this
meeting will be among the most historic in the history of the world.  In the
name of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, presided over by
Libya, of the African Union, of one thousand traditional African kingdoms and
in my own name, I would like to take this opportunity, as President of the
African Union, to congratulate our son Obama because he is attending the
General Assembly, and we welcome him as his country is hosting this meeting.

This session is taking place in the midst of so many challenges facing us, and
the whole world should come together and unite its efforts to defeat the
challenges that are our principal common enemy — those of climate change and
international crises such as the capitalist economic decline, the food and
water crises, desertification, terrorism, immigration, piracy, man-made and
natural epidemics and nuclear proliferation. **Perhaps influenza H1N1 was a virus
created in a laboratory that got out of control, originally being meant as a
military weapon. Such challenges also include hypocrisy, poverty, fear,
materialism and immorality.** 

As is known, the United Nations was founded by three or four countries against
Germany at the time. The United Nations was formed by the nations that joined
together against Germany in the Second World War. Those countries formed a body
called the Security Council, made its own countries permanent members and
granted them the power of veto. We were not present at that time. The United
Nations was shaped in line with those three countries and wanted us to step
into shoes originally designed against Germany. That is the real substance of
the United Nations when it was founded over 60 years ago.

That happened in the absence of some 165 countries, at a ratio of one to eight;
that is, one was present and eight were absent. They created the Charter, of
which I have a copy. If one reads the Charter of the United Nations, one finds
that the Preamble of the Charter differs from its Articles. How did it come
into existence? All those who attended the San Francisco Conference in 1945
participated in creating the Preamble, but they left the Articles and internal
rules of procedures of the so-called Security Council to experts, specialists
and interested countries, which were those countries that had established the
Security Council and had united against Germany.

The Preamble is very appealing, and no one objects to it, but all the
provisions that follow it completely contradict the Preamble. We reject such
provisions, and we will never uphold them; they ended with the Second World
War. The Preamble says that all nations, small or large, are equal. Are we
equal when it comes to the permanent seats? No, we are not equal. The Preamble
states in writing that all nations are equal whether they are small or large.
Do we have the right of veto? Are we equal? The Preamble says that we have
equal rights, whether we are large or small. That is what is stated and what we
agreed in the Preamble. So the veto contradicts the Charter. The permanent
seats contradict the Charter. We neither accept nor recognize the veto. 

The Preamble of the Charter states that armed force shall not be used, save in
the common interest. That is the Preamble that we agreed to and signed, and we
joined the United Nations because we wanted the Charter to reflect that. It
says that armed force shall only be used in the common interest of all nations,
but what has happened since then? Sixty-five wars have broken out since the
establishment of the United Nations and the Security Council — 65 since their
creation, with millions more victims than in the Second World War. Are those
wars, and the aggression and force that were used in those 65 wars, in the
common interest of us all? No, they were in the interest of one or three or
four countries, but not of all nations. 

We will talk about whether those wars were in the interest of one country or of
all nations. That flagrantly contradicts the Charter of the United Nations that
we signed, and unless we act in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations to which we agreed, we will reject it and not be afraid not to speak
diplomatically to anyone. Now we are talking about the future of the United
Nations. There should be no hypocrisy or diplomacy because it concerns the
important and vital issue of the future of the world. It was hypocrisy that
brought about the 65 wars since the establishment of the United Nations.

The Preamble also states that if armed force is used, it must be a United
Nations force — thus, military intervention by the United Nations, with the
joint agreement of the United Nations, not one or two or three countries using
armed force. The entire United Nations will decide to go to war to maintain
international peace and security. Since the establishment of the United Nations
in 1945, if there is an act of aggression by one country against another, the
entire United Nations should deter and stop that act. 

If a country, Libya for instance, were to exhibit aggression against France,
then the entire Organization would respond because France is a sovereign State
Member of the United Nations and we all share the collective responsibility to
protect the sovereignty of all nations. However, 65 aggressive wars have taken
place without any United Nations action to prevent them. Eight other massive,
fierce wars, whose victims number some 2 million, have been waged by Member
States that enjoy veto powers. Those countries that would have us believe they
seek to maintain the sovereignty and independence of peoples actually use
aggressive force against peoples. While we would like to believe that these
countries want to work for peace and security in the world and protect peoples,
they have instead resorted to aggressive wars and hostile behavior. Enjoying
the veto they granted themselves as permanent members of the Security Council,
they have initiated wars that have claimed millions of victims.

The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States is
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. No country, therefore, has the
right to interfere in the affairs of any Government, be it democratic or
dictatorial, socialist or capitalist, reactionary or progressive. This is the
responsibility of each society; it is an internal matter for the people of the
country concerned. The senators of Rome once appointed their leader, Julius
Caesar, as dictator because it was good for Rome at that time. No one can say
of Rome at that time that it gave Caesar the veto. The veto is not mentioned in
the Charter. 

We joined the United Nations because we thought we were equals, only to find
that one country can object to all the decisions we make. Who gave the
permanent members their status in the Security Council? Four of them granted
this status to themselves. The only country that we in this Assembly elected to
permanent member status in the Security Council is China. This was done
democratically, but the other seats were imposed upon us undemocratically
through a dictatorial procedure carried out against our will, and we should not
accept it.  The Security Council reform we need is not an increase in the
number of members, which would only make things worse. To use a common
expression, if you add more water, you get more mud. It would add insult to
injury. It would make things worse simply by adding more large countries to
those that already enjoy membership of the Council. It would merely perpetuate
the proliferation of super-Powers. We therefore reject the addition of any more
permanent seats. The solution is not to have more permanent seats, which would
be very dangerous. Adding more super-Powers would crush the peoples of small,
vulnerable and third world countries, which are coming together in what has
been called the Group of 100 — 100 small countries banding together in a forum
that one member has called **the Forum of Small States**.

These countries would be crushed by super-Powers were additional large
countries to be granted membership in the Security Council. This door must be
closed; we reject it strongly and categorically. Adding more seats to the
Security Council would increase poverty, injustice and tension at the world
level, as well as great competition between certain countries such as Italy,
Germany, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Japan, Brazil, Nigeria,
Argentina, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South
Africa, Tanzania, Turkey, Iran, Greece and Ukraine. All these countries would
seek a seat on the Security Council, making its membership almost as large as
that of the General Assembly and resulting in an impractical competition.  What
solution can there be? The solution is for the General Assembly to adopt a
binding resolution under the leadership of Mr. Treki based on the majority will
of Assembly members and taking into account the considerations of no other
body. The solution is to close Security Council membership to the admission of
further States. This item is on the agenda of the General Assembly during the
present session presided over by Mr. Treki. Membership through unions and the
transference of mandates should supersede other proposals.

We should focus on the achievement of democracy based on the equality of Member
States. There should be equality among Member States and the powers and
mandates of the Security Council should be transferred to the General Assembly.
Membership should be for unions, not for States. Increasing the number of
States Members would give the right to all countries to a seat, in accordance
with the spirit of the Preamble of the Charter. 

No country could deny a seat in the Council to Italy, for instance, if a seat
were given to Germany. For the sake of argument, Italy might say that Germany
was an aggressive country and was defeated in the Second World War. If we gave
India a seat, Pakistan would say that it, too, is a nuclear country and
deserves a seat, and those two countries are at war. This would be a dangerous
situation. If we gave a seat to Japan, then we should have to give one to
Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world. Then Turkey, Iran and
Ukraine would make the same claim. What could we say to Argentina or Brazil?
Libya deserves a seat for its efforts in the service of world security by
discarding its weapons of mass destruction programme. Then South Africa,
Tanzania and Ukraine would demand the same. All of these countries are
important. The door to Security Council membership should be closed.

This approach is a falsehood, a trick that has been exposed. If we want to
reform the United Nations, bringing in more super-Powers is not the way. The
solution is to foster democracy at the level of the general congress of the
world, the General Assembly, to which the powers of the Security Council should
be transferred. The Security Council would become merely an instrument for
implementing the decisions taken by the General Assembly, which would be the
parliament, the legislative assembly, of the world. 

This Assembly is our democratic forum and the Security Council should be
responsible before it; we should not accept the current situation. These are
the legislators of the Members of the United Nations, and their resolutions
should be binding. It is said that the General Assembly should do whatever the
Security Council recommends. On the contrary, the Security Council should do
whatever the General Assembly decides. This is the United Nations, the Assembly
that includes 192 countries. It is not the Security Council, which includes
only 15 of the Member States.

How can we be happy about global peace and security if the whole world is
controlled by only five countries? We are 192 nations and countries, and we are
like Speakers’ Corner in London’s Hyde Park. We just speak and nobody
implements our decisions. We are mere decoration, without any real substance.
We are Speakers’ Corner, no more, no less. We just make speeches and then
disappear. This is who you are right now.

Once the Security Council becomes only an executive body for resolutions
adopted by the General Assembly, there will be no competition for membership of
the Council. Once the Security Council becomes a tool to implement General
Assembly resolutions, there will be no need for any competition. The Security
Council should, quite simply, represent all nations. In accordance with the
proposal submitted to the General Assembly, there would be permanent seats on
the Security Council for all unions and groups of countries.

The 27 countries of the European Union should have a permanent seat on the
Security Council. The countries of the African Union should have a permanent
seat on the Security Council. The Latin American and ASEAN countries should
have permanent seats. The Russian Federation and the United States of America
are already permanent members of the Security Council. The Southern African
Development Community (SADC), once it is fully established, should have a
permanent seat. The 22 countries of the Arab League should have a permanent
seat. The 57 countries of the Islamic Conference should have a permanent seat.
The 118 countries of the Non-Aligned Movement should have a permanent seat.
Then there is the G-100; perhaps the small countries should also have a
permanent seat. Countries not included in the unions that I have mentioned
could perhaps be assigned a permanent seat, to be occupied by them in rotation
every six or twelve months. I am thinking of countries like Japan and Australia
that are outside such organizations as ASEAN or like the Russian Federation
that is not a member of the European or Latin American or African unions. This
would be a solution for them if the General Assembly votes in favor of it.

The issue is a vitally important one. As has already been mentioned, the
General Assembly is the Congress and Parliament of the world, the leader of the
world. We are the nations, and anyone outside this General Assembly will not be
recognized. The President of the Assembly, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, and
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will produce the legal draft and set up the
necessary committees to submit this proposal to a vote: that from now on, the
Security Council will be made up of unions of nations. In this way, we will
have justice and democracy, and we will no longer have a Security Council
consisting of countries which have been chosen because they have nuclear
weapons, large economies or advanced technology. That is terrorism. We cannot
allow the Security Council to be run by super-Powers; that is terrorism in and
of itself.  If we want a world that is united, safe and peaceful, this is what
we should do. If we want to remain in a world at war, that is up to you. We
will continue to have conflict and to fight until doomsday or the end of the
world. All Security Council members should have the right to exercise the veto,
or else we should eliminate the whole concept of the veto with this new
formation of the Council. This would be a real Security Council. According to
the new proposals submitted to the General Assembly, it will be an executive
council under the control of the General Assembly, which will have the real
power and make all the rules.  In this way, all countries will be on an equal
footing in the Security Council just as they are in the General Assembly. In
the General Assembly we are all treated equally when it comes to membership and
voting. It should be the same in the Security Council. Currently, one country
has a veto; another country does not have a veto; one country has a permanent
seat; another country does not have a permanent seat. We should not accept
this, nor should we accept any resolution adopted by the Security Council in
its current composition. We were under trusteeship; we were colonized; and now
we are independent. We are here today to decide the future of the world in a
democratic way that will maintain the peace and security of all nations, large
and small, as equals. Otherwise, it is terrorism, for terrorism is not just Al
Qaeda but can also take other forms.  We should be guided by the majority of
the votes in the General Assembly alone. If the General Assembly takes a
decision by voting, then its wishes should be obeyed and its decision should be
enforced. No one is above the General Assembly; anyone who says he is above the
Assembly should leave the United Nations and be on his own. Democracy is not
for the rich or the most powerful or for those who practice terrorism. All
nations should be and should be seen to be on an equal footing.

At present, the Security Council is security feudalism, political feudalism for
those with permanent seats, protected by them and used against us. It should be
called, not the Security Council, but the Terror Council. In our political
life, if they need to use the Security Council against us, they turn to the
Security Council. If they have no need to use it against us, they ignore the
Security Council. If they have an interest to promote, an axe to grind, they
respect and glorify the Charter of the United Nations; they turn to Chapter VII
of the Charter and use it against poor nations. If, however, they wished to
violate the Charter, they would ignore it as if it did not exist at all.  If
the veto of the permanent members of the Security Council is given to those who
have the power, this is injustice and terrorism and should not be tolerated by
us. We should not live in the shadow of this injustice and terror.
Super-Powers have complicated global interests, and they use the veto to
protect those interests. For example, in the Security Council, they use the
power of the United Nations to protect their interests and to terrorize and
intimidate the Third World, causing it to live under the shadow of terror.

From the beginning, since it was established in 1945, the Security Council has
failed to provide security. On the contrary, it has provided terror and
sanctions. It is only used against us. For this reason, we will no longer be
committed to implementing Security Council resolutions after this speech, which
marks the 40th anniversary.  Sixty-five wars have broken out: either fighting
among small countries or wars of aggression waged against us by super-Powers.
The Security Council, in clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations,
failed to take action to stop these wars or acts of aggressions against small
nations and peoples.  The General Assembly will vote on a number of historic
proposals. Either we act as one or we will fragment. If each nation were to
have its own version of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the
various instruments and each were to have an equal footing, the Powers that
currently fill the permanent seats would be confined to use of their own
sovereign bodies, whether there be three or four of them, and would have to
exercise their rights against themselves. This is of no concern to us.

If they want to keep their permanent seats, that is fine; permanent seats will
be of no concern to us. We shall never submit to their control or to their
exercise of the veto that was given to them. We are not so foolish as to give
the right of veto to the super-Powers to use so they can treat us as
second-class citizens and as outcast nations. It is not we who decided that
those countries are the super-Powers and respected nations with the power to
act on behalf of 192 countries.

You should be fully aware that we are ignoring the Security Council resolutions
because those resolutions are used solely against us and not against the
super-Powers which have the permanent seats and the right of veto. Those Powers
never use any resolutions against themselves.

They are, however, used against us. Such use has turned the United Nations into
a travesty of itself and has generated wars and violations of the sovereignty
of independent States. It has led to war crimes and genocides. All of this is
in violation of the Charter of the United Nations.  Since no one pays attention
to the Security Council of the United Nations, each country and community has
established its own security council, and the Security Council here has become
isolated.

The African Union has already established its own Peace and Security Council,
the European Union has already established a security council, and Asian
countries have already established their own security council. Soon, Latin
America will have its own Security Council as will the 120 non-aligned nations.

This means that we have already lost confidence in the United Nations Security
Council, which has not provided us with security, and that is why we now are
creating new regional security councils.  We are not committed to obeying the
rules or the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council in its present
form because it is undemocratic, dictatorial and unjust. No one can force us to
join the Security Council or to obey or comply with resolutions or orders given
by the Security Council in its present composition.

Furthermore, there is no respect for the United Nations and no regard for the
General Assembly, which is actually the true United Nations, but whose
resolutions are non-binding. The decisions of the International Court of
Justice, the international judicial body, take aim only at small countries and
Third World nations. Powerful countries escape the notice of the Court. Or, if
judicial decisions are taken against these powerful countries, they are not
enforced.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an important agency
within the United Nations. Powerful countries, however, are not accountable to
it or under its jurisdiction. We have discovered that the IAEA is used only
against us. We are told that it is an international organization, but, if that
is the case, then all the countries of the world should be under its
jurisdiction. If it is not truly international, then right after this speech we
should no longer accept it and should close it down.

Mr. Treki, in his capacity as President of the General Assembly, should talk to
the Director General of the IAEA, Mr. ElBaradei, and should ask him if he is
prepared to verify nuclear energy storage in all countries and inspect all
suspected increases. If he says yes, then we accept the Agency’s jurisdiction.
But if he says that he cannot go into certain countries that have nuclear power
and that he does not have any jurisdiction over them, then we should close the
Agency down and not submit to its jurisdiction.

For your information, I called Mr. ElBaradei when we had the problem of the
Libyan nuclear bomb. I called Mr. ElBaradei and asked him if the agreements by
the super-Powers to reduce nuclear supplies were subject to Agency control and
under inspection, and whether he was aware of any increases in their activity.
He told me that he was not in a position to ask the super-Powers to be
inspected.  So, is the Agency only inspecting us? If so, it does not qualify as
an international organization since it is selective, just like the Security
Council and the International Court of Justice. This is not equitable nor is it
the United Nations. We totally reject this situation.  Regarding Africa, Mr.
President, whether the United Nations is reformed or not, and even before a
vote is taken on any proposals of a historic nature, Africa should be given a
permanent seat on the Security Council now, having already waited too long.

Leaving aside United Nations reform, we can certainly say that Africa was
colonized, isolated and persecuted and its rights usurped. Its people were
enslaved and treated like animals, and its territory was colonized and placed
under trusteeship. The countries of the African Union deserve a permanent seat.
This is a debt from the past that has to be paid and has nothing to do with
United Nations reform. It is a priority matter and is high on the agenda of the
General Assembly. No one can say that the African Union does not deserve a
permanent seat.  Who can argue with this proposal? I challenge anyone to make a
case against it. Where is the proof that the African Union or the African
continent does not deserve a permanent seat? No one can possibly deny this.
Another matter that should be voted on in the General Assembly is that of
compensation for countries that were colonized, so as to prevent the
colonization of a continent, the usurpation of its rights and the pillaging of
its wealth from happening again.  Why are Africans going to Europe? Why are
Asians going to Europe? Why are Latin Americans going to Europe? It is because
Europe colonized those peoples and stole the material and human resources of
Africa, Asia and Latin America — the oil, minerals, uranium, gold and diamonds,
the fruit, vegetables and livestock and the people — and used them. Now, new
generations of Asians, Latin Americans and Africans are seeking to reclaim that
stolen wealth, as they have the right to do.

At the Libyan border, I recently stopped 1,000 African migrants headed for
Europe. I asked them why they were going there. They told me it was to take
back their stolen wealth — that they would not be leaving otherwise. Who can
restore the wealth that was taken from us? If you decide to restore all of this
wealth, there will be no more immigration from the Philippines, Latin America,
Mauritius and India. Let us have the wealth that was stolen from us. Africa
deserves $777 trillion in compensation from the countries that colonized it.
Africans will demand that amount, and if you do not give it to them, they will
go to where you have taken those trillions of dollars. They have the right to
do so. They have to follow that money and to bring it back.

Why is there no Libyan immigration to Italy, even though Libya is so close by?
Italy owed compensation to the Libyan people. It accepted that fact and signed
an agreement with Libya, which was adopted by both the Italian and Libyan
Parliaments. Italy admitted that its colonization of Libya was wrong and should
never be repeated, and it promised not to attack the Libyan people by land, air
or sea. Italy also agreed to provide Libya with $250 million a year in
compensation over the next 20 years and to build a hospital for Libyans maimed
as a result of the mines planted in Libyan territory during the Second World
War. Italy apologized and promised that it would never again occupy the
territory of another country. Italy, which was a kingdom during the Fascist
regime and has made rich contributions to civilization, should be commended for
this achievement, together with Prime Minister Berlusconi and his predecessor,
who made their own contributions in that regard.

Why is the Third World demanding compensation? So that there will be no more
colonization — so that large and powerful countries will not colonize, knowing
that they will have to pay compensation. Colonization should be punished. The
countries that harmed other peoples during the colonial era should pay
compensation for the damage and suffering inflicted under their colonial rule.

There is another point that I would like to make. However, before doing so —
and addressing a somewhat sensitive issue — I should like to make an aside. We
Africans are happy and proud indeed that a son of Africa is now President of
the United States of America. That is a historic event. Now, in a country where
blacks once could not mingle with whites, in cafés or restaurants, or sit next
to them on a bus, the American people have elected as their President a young
black man, Mr. Obama, of Kenyan heritage. That is a wonderful thing, and we are
proud. It marks the beginning of a change. However, as far as I am concerned,
Obama is a temporary relief for the next four or eight years. I am afraid that
we may then go back to square one. No one can guarantee how America will be
governed after Obama.

We would be content if Obama could remain President of the United States of
America for ever. The statement that he just made shows that he is completely
different from any American President that we have seen. American Presidents
used to threaten us with all manner of weapons, saying that they would send us
Desert Storm, Grapes of Wrath, Rolling Thunder and poisonous roses for Libyan
children. That was their approach. American Presidents used to threaten us with
operations such as Rolling Thunder, sent to Viet Nam; Desert Storm, sent to
Iraq; Musketeer, sent to Egypt in 1956, even though America opposed it; and the
poisonous roses visited upon Libyan children by Reagan. Can you imagine? One
would have thought that Presidents of a large country with a permanent seat on
the Security Council and the right of veto would have protected us and sent us
peace. And what did we get instead? Laser-guided bombs carried to us on F-111
aircraft. This was their approach: we will lead the world, whether you like it
or not, and will punish anyone who opposes us.

What our son Obama said today is completely different. He made a serious appeal
for nuclear disarmament, which we applaud. He also said that America alone
could not solve the problems facing us and that the entire world should come
together to do so. He said that we must do more than we are doing now, which is
making speeches. We agree with that and applaud it. He said that we had come to
the United Nations to talk against one another. It is true that when we come
here, we should communicate with one another on an equal footing. And he said
that democracy should not be imposed from outside. Until recently, American
Presidents have said that democracy should be imposed on Iraq and other
countries. He said that this was an internal affair. He spoke truly when he
said that democracy cannot be imposed from outside.

So we have to be cautious. Before I make these sensitive remarks I note that
the whole world has so many polarities. Listen: should we have a world of so
many polarities? Can we not have nations on an equal footing? Let us have an
answer. Does anyone have an answer as to whether it is better to have a world
of so many polarities? Why can we not have equal standing? Should we have
patriarchs? Should we have popes? Should we have gods?

Why should we have a world of so many polarities? We reject such a world and
call for a world where big and small are equal.  The other sensitive point is
the Headquarters of the United Nations. Can I have your attention, please? All
of you came across the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, crossing the Asian
continent or the African continent to reach this place. Why? Is this Jerusalem?
Is this the Vatican? Is this Mecca? All of you are tired, have jet lag, and
have sleepless nights. You are very tired, very low, physically. Somebody just
arrived now, flying 20 hours. Then we want him to make a speech and talk about
this.

All of you are asleep, all of you are tired. It is clear that all of you are
lacking energy because of having to make a long journey. Why do we do that?
Some of our countries are in nighttime and people are asleep. Now you should be
asleep, because your biological clock, your biological mind is accustomed to be
asleep at this time. I wake up at 4 o’clock New York time, before dawn, because
in Libya it is 11 in the morning. When I wake up at 11 o’clock it is supposed
to be daytime; at 4 o’clock I am awake.

Why? Think about it. If this was decided in 1945, should we still retain it?
Why can we not think about a place that is in the middle, that is comfortable?

Another important point is that America, the host country, bears the expenses
and looks after the Headquarters and diplomatic missions and looks after the
peace and security of the heads of State who come here. They are very strict;
they spend a lot of money, New York and all of America being very tight. 

I want to relieve America of this hardship. We should thank America; we say to
America, thank you for all the trouble that you have taken on yourself. We say
thank you to America. We want to help reassure America and New York and keep
them calm. They should not have the responsibility of looking after security.
Perhaps some day a terrorist could cause an explosion or bomb a president. This
place is targeted by Al-Qaeda, this very building. Why was it not hit on 11
September? It was beyond their power. The next target would be this place. I am
not saying this in an offhand manner. We have tens of members of Al-Qaeda
detained in Libyan prisons. Their confessions are very scary. That makes
America live under tension. One never knows what will happen. Perhaps America
or this place will be targeted again by a rocket. Perhaps tens of heads of
State will die. We want to relieve America from this worry. We shall take the
place to where it is not targeted.  Now after 50 years United Nations
Headquarters should be taken to another part of the hemisphere. After 50 years
in the western hemisphere, for the next 50 years it should be in the eastern
hemisphere or in the middle hemisphere, by rotation. Now, with 64 years we have
an extra 14 years over the 50 that Headquarters should have been moved to
somewhere else.

This is not an insult to America; it is a service to America. We should thank
America. This was possible in 1945, but we should not accept it now. Of course
this should be put to the vote in the General Assembly — only in the Assembly,
because in section 23 of the Headquarters Agreement it says that the United
Nations Headquarters can be moved to another location only by a resolution of
the General Assembly. If 51 per cent of the Assembly approves relocation of
Headquarters, then it can be moved.

America has the right to make security tight because it is targeted by
terrorists and by Al-Qaeda. America has the right to take all security
measures; we are not blaming America for that. However, we do not tolerate
these measures. We do not have to come to New York and be subjected to all
these measures. One president told me that he was told that his co-pilot should
not come to America because there are restrictions. He asked how he could cross
the Atlantic without a co-pilot. Why? He does not have to come here. Another
president complained that his honor guard could not come because there was some
misunderstanding regarding his name when it came to granting a visa. Another
president said his own doctor could not get a visa and could not come to
America.

The security measures are very strict. If a country has any problem with
America, they will set up restrictions on the movements of member delegations,
as if one is in Guantanamo. Is this a Member State of the United Nations, or is
it a prisoner in the Guantanamo camp that cannot be allowed free movement?

This is what is submitted to the General Assembly for a vote — moving the
Headquarters. If 51 per cent agree, then we come to the second vote: to the
middle of the globe, or to the eastern part. If we say that we must move the
Headquarters to the middle of the hemisphere, why do we not move to Sirte or
Vienna? One can come even without a visa. Once you come as a president, Libya
is a secure country. We are not going to restrict you to 100 or 500 meters.
Libya has no hostile actions against anybody. I think the same holds true of
Vienna.

If the vote says we should move Headquarters to the eastern part, then it will
be Delhi or Beijing, the capital of China or the capital of India.  That is
logical, my brothers. I do not think there will be any objection to that. Then
you will thank me for this proposal, for eliminating the suffering and the
trouble of flying 14, 15 or 20 hours to come here. No one can blame America or
say that America will reduce its contributions to the United Nations. No one
should have that bad thought. America, I am sure, is committed to its
international obligations. America will not be angry; it will thank you for
alleviating its hardship, for taking on all that hardship and all the
restrictions, even though this place is targeted by terrorists. 

We come now to the issues that will be considered by the General Assembly. We
are about to put the United Nations on trial; the old organization will be
finished and a new one will emerge. This is not a normal gathering. Even son
Obama said that this is not a normal gathering. It is a historic meeting.

The wars that took place after the establishment of the United Nations — why
did they occur? Where was the Security Council, where was the Charter, where
was the United Nations? There should be investigations and judicial
intervention. Why have there been massacres? We can start with the Korean War
because it took place after the establishment of the United Nations. How did a
war break out and cause millions of victims? Nuclear weapons could have been
used in that war. Those who are responsible for causing the war should be tried
and should pay compensation and damages.

Then we come to the Suez Canal war of 1956. That file should be opened wide.
Three countries with permanent seats on the Security Council and with the right
of veto in the Council attacked a member State of this General Assembly. A
country that was a sovereign State — Egypt — was attacked, its army was
destroyed, thousands of Egyptians were killed and many Egyptian towns and
entities were destroyed, all because Egypt wanted to nationalize the Suez
Canal. How could such a thing have happened during the era of the United
Nations and its Charter? How is it possible to guarantee that such a thing will
not be repeated unless we make amends for past wrongs? Those were dangerous
events and the Suez Canal and Korean War files should be re-opened.

Next we come to the Viet Nam war. There were 3 million victims of that war.
During 12 days, more bombs were dropped than during four years of the Second
World War. It was a fiercer war, and it took place after the establishment of
the United Nations and after we had decided that there would be no more wars.

The future of humankind is at stake. We cannot stay silent. How can we feel
safe? How can we be complacent? This is the future of the world, and we who are
in the General Assembly of the United Nations must make sure that such wars are
not repeated in the future.  Then Panama was attacked, even though it was an
independent member State of the General Assembly. Four thousand people were
killed, and the President of that country was taken prisoner and put in prison.
Noriega should be released — we should open that file. How can we entitle a
country that is a United Nations Member State to wage war against another
country and capture its president, treat him as a criminal and put him in
prison? Who would accept that? It could be repeated. We should not stay quiet.
We should have an investigation. Any one of us Member States could face the
same situation, especially if such aggression is by a Member State with a
permanent seat on the Security Council and with the responsibility to maintain
peace and security worldwide.

Then there was the war in Grenada. That country was invaded even though it was
a Member State. It was attacked by 5,000 war ships, 7,000 troops and dozens of
military aircraft, and it is the smallest country in the world. This occurred
after the establishment of the United Nations and of the Security Council and
its veto. And the President of Grenada, Mr. Maurice Bishop, was assassinated.
How could that have happened with impunity? It is a tragedy. How can we
guarantee that the United Nations is good or not, that a certain country is
good or not? Can we be safe or happy about our future or not? Can we trust the
Security Council or not? Can we trust the United Nations or not?  We must look
into and investigate the bombing of Somalia. Somalia is a United Nations Member
State. It is an independent country under the rule of Aidid. We want an
investigation. Why did that happen? Who allowed it to happen? Who gave the
green light for that country to be attacked?

Then there is the former Yugoslavia. No country was as peaceful as Yugoslavia,
constructed step by step and piece by piece after being destroyed by Hitler. We
destroyed it, as if we were doing the same job as Hitler. Tito built that
peaceful country step by step and brick by brick and then we arrived and broke
it apart for imperialistic, personal interests. How can we be complacent about
that? Why can we not be satisfied? If a peaceful country like Yugoslavia faced
such a tragedy, the General Assembly should have an investigation and should
decide who should be tried before the International Criminal Court.

Then we have the war in Iraq — the mother of all evils. The United Nations
should also investigate that. The General Assembly, presided over by Mr. Treki,
should investigate that. The invasion of Iraq was a violation of the United
Nations Charter. It was done without any justification by super-Powers with
permanent seats on the Security Council. Iraq is an independent country and a
member State of the General Assembly. How could those countries attack Iraq? As
provided for in the Charter, the United Nations should have intervened and
stopped the attack.

We spoke in the General Assembly and urged it to use the Charter to stop that
attack. We were against the invasion of Kuwait, and the Arab countries fought
Iraq alongside foreign countries in the name of the United Nations Charter.

In the first instance, the Charter was respected. The second time when we
wanted to use the Charter to stop the war against Iraq, no one used it and that
document was ignored. Why did that occur? Mr. Treki and the General Assembly
should investigate to determine whether there was any reason at all to invade
Iraq. Because the reasons for that attack remain mysterious and ambiguous, and
we might face the same destiny.

Why was Iraq invaded? The invasion itself was a serious violation of the United
Nations Charter, and it was wrong. There was also a total massacre or genocide.
More than 1.5 million Iraqis were killed. We want to bring the Iraqi file
before the International Criminal Court (ICC), and we want those who committed
mass murder against the Iraqi people to be tried.

It is easy for Charles Taylor to be tried, or for Bashir to be tried, or for
Noriega to be tried. That is an easy job. Yes, but what about those who have
committed mass murder against the Iraqis? They cannot be tried? They cannot go
before the ICC? If the Court is unable to accommodate us, then we should not
accept it. Either it is meant for all of us, large or small, or we should not
accept it and should reject it.  Anyone who commits a war crime can be tried,
but we are not livestock or animals like those that are slaughtered for the
Eid. We have the right to live, and we are ready to fight and to defend
ourselves. We have the right to live in dignity, under the sun and on earth;
they have already tested us and we have withstood the test.

There are other things as well. Why is it that Iraqi prisoners of war can be
sentenced to death? When Iraq was invaded and the President of Iraq was taken
he was a prisoner of war. He should not have been tried; he should not have
been hanged. When the war was over, he should have been released. We want to
know why a prisoner of war should have been tried. Who sentenced the President
of Iraq to death? Is there an answer to that question? We know the identity of
the judge who tried him. As to who tied the noose around the President’s neck
on the day of sacrifice and hanged him, those people wore masks.

How could this have happened in a civilized world? These were prisoners of war
of civilized countries under international law. How could Government ministers
and a head of State be sentenced to death and hanged? Were those who tried them
lawyers or members of a judicial system?

Do you know what people are saying? They are saying that the faces behind the
masks were those of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister
of the United Kingdom and that it was they who put the President of Iraq to
death.

Why do the executioners not unmask their faces? Why do we not know their ranks?
Why do we not know whether they were officers, judges, soldiers or doctors? How
does it come about that the President of a State Member of the United Nations
was sentenced to death and killed? We do not know the identity of the
executioners. The United Nations is duty-bound to answer these questions: who
carried out the death sentence? They must have legal status and official
responsibilities; we should know their identities and we should know about the
presence of a physician and the nature of all the legal proceedings. That would
be true for an ordinary citizen, let alone for the President of a State Member
of the United Nations who was put to death in that manner.

My third point on the Iraq war relates to Abu Ghraib. This was a disgrace to
humankind. I know that the United States authorities will investigate this
scandal, but the United Nations must not ignore it either. The General Assembly
should investigate this matter. Prisoners of war held in Abu Ghraib prison were
torturers; dogs were set on them; men were raped. This is unprecedented in the
history of war. It was sodomy, and it was an unprecedented sin, never before
committed by past aggressors or invaders. Prisoners of war are soldiers, but
these were raped in prison by a State, a permanent member of the Security
Council. This goes against civilization and humankind. We must not keep silent;
we must know the facts. Even today, a quarter of a million Iraqi prisoners, men
and women alike, remain in Abu Ghraib. They are being maltreated, persecuted
and raped. There must be an investigation.

Turning to the war in Afghanistan, this too must be investigated. Why are we
against the Taliban? Why are we against Afghanistan? Who are the Taliban? If
the Taliban want a religious State, that is fine. Think of the Vatican. Does
the Vatican pose a threat to us? No. It is a religious, very peaceful State. If
the Taliban want to create an Islamic Emirate, who says that this makes them an
enemy? Is anyone claiming that Bin Laden is of the Taliban or that he is
Afghan? Is Bin Laden of the Taliban? No; he is not of the Taliban and he is not
Afghan. Were the terrorists who hit New York City of the Taliban? Were they
from Afghanistan? They were neither Taliban nor Afghan. Then, what was the
reason for the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan?

If I truly wanted to deceive my American and British friends, I would encourage
them to send more troops and I would encourage them to persist in this
bloodbath. But they will never succeed in Iraq or Afghanistan. Look what
happened to them in Iraq, which is a desert. It is even worse in mountainous
Afghanistan. If I wanted to deceive them I would tell them to continue the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan. But no, I want to save the citizens of the United
States, the United Kingdom and other countries who are fighting in Iraq and
Afghanistan. So I tell them: leave Afghanistan to the Afghans; leave Iraq to
the Iraqis. If they want to fight each other, they are free to do so.

America had its Civil War, and no one interfered in it. There were civil wars
in Spain, China and countries all over the world — no place on Earth has been
free of civil wars. Let there be a civil war in Iraq. If the Iraqis want to
have a civil war and fight each other, that is fine. Who says that if the
Taliban form a Government they would possess intercontinental missiles or the
kind of airplanes that hit New York? Did those airplanes take off from
Afghanistan or Iraq? No; they took off from American airports. So why is
Afghanistan being struck? The terrorists were not Afghans or Taliban or Iraqis.
Why are we silent? We must never be war devils: anyone who does not speak the
truth is a silent devil. We are committed to international peace and security.
We do not wish to scorn or ridicule humankind. We want to save humanity.

As President of the General Assembly, Mr. Ali Treki should open an
investigation of the assassinations file — in addition to the war files. Who
killed Patrice Lumumba, and why? We merely want to record it in the annals of
African history; we want to know how an African leader, a liberator, came to be
assassinated. Who killed him? We want our sons to be able to read the history
of how Patrice Lumumba, the hero of Congo’s liberation struggle, was
assassinated. We want to know the facts, even 50 years on. That is one file
that should be reopened.  And who killed Secretary-General Hammarskjöld? Who
fired on his aero plane in 1961, and why?

**Then, there is the assassination of United States President Kennedy in 1963. We
want to know who killed him and why. There was somebody called Lee Harvey
Oswald, who was then killed by one Jack Ruby. Why did he kill him? Jack Ruby,
an Israeli, killed Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed Kennedy. Why did this Israeli
kill Kennedy’s killer? Then Jack Ruby, the killer of the killer of Kennedy,
died in mysterious circumstances before he could be tried. We must open the
files. The whole world knows that Kennedy wanted to investigate the Israeli
Dimona nuclear reactor. This involves international peace and security and
weapons of mass destruction. That is why we should open this file.  Then there
is the assassination of Martin Luther King, the black reverend and human rights
activist. His assassination was a plot, and we should know why he was killed
and who killed him.**

Then Khalil Wazir, or Abu Jihad, a Palestinian, was attacked. He was living
peacefully in Tunisia, a Member State, and that country’s sovereignty was not
respected. We cannot keep silent. Even though submarines and ships were
detected along the coast of Tunisia, where he was killed, no one was accused or
tried. Abu Iyad was also killed, and we should know how he was killed. He was
killed in ambiguous circumstances. In Operation Spring of Youth, Kamal Nasser,
a poet, Kamal Adwan and Abu Youssef al Najjar, three Palestinians, were killed
in Lebanon, a country that is a free, sovereign State member of the General
Assembly. They were attacked and killed while sleeping peacefully. We should
know who killed them, and he should be tried so that those crimes against
humanity are not repeated.

We have already talked about the size of the force used in the invasion of
Grenada — 7,000 troops, 15 battleships and dozens of bombers — and President
Bishop was killed even though Grenada was a Member State. Those are crimes, and
we cannot keep silent. Otherwise, we will look like sacrificial beasts. We are
not animals. Year after year, we are attacked. We defend ourselves, our sons
and our children, and we are not afraid. We have the right to live, and the
Earth is not destined for violence, but for us all. We can never live on this
Earth in such humiliation. So those are the wars.

The last file is that of the massacres. In the Sabra and Shatila massacre,
3,000 people were killed. That area, under the protection of the occupying
Israeli army, was the site of a huge and calamitous massacre in which 3,000
Palestinian men, women and children were killed. How can we keep quiet? Lebanon
is a sovereign State; a member of the General Assembly was occupied, Sabra and
Shatila were under Israeli control, and then the massacre took place.

Then there was the 2008 massacre in Gaza. There were 1,000 women and 2,200
children among the victims killed in the massacre in Gaza in 2008. Sixty United
Nations facilities and another 30 belonging to non-governmental organizations
were damaged. Fifty clinics were destroyed. Forty doctors and nurses were
killed while carrying out humanitarian activities. This took place in Gaza in
December 2008.  The perpetrators are still alive, and they should be tried by
the International Criminal Court (ICC). Should we try only the underdogs, the
weak and the poor of third-world countries, and not important and protected
figures? Under international law, they should all face trial for the
consequences of the crimes that they have committed. Otherwise, the role of the
ICC will never be recognized. If the decisions of the ICC are not respected or
implemented, if the General Assembly and the Security Council mean nothing, and
if the International Atomic Energy Agency serves only certain countries and
organizations, then what is the United Nations? It would mean that the United
Nations is nothing and is insignificant. Where is it? There is no United
Nations.

Then, while piracy may be a phenomenon of the high seas, a form of terrorism,
we talk about the piracy in Somalia. Somalis are not pirates. We are the
pirates. We went there and usurped their economic zones, their fish and their
wealth. Libya, India, Japan and America — any country in the world — we are all
pirates. We all entered the territorial waters and economic zones of Somalia
and stole. The Somalis are protecting their own fish, their sustenance. They
have become pirates because they are defending their children’s food. Now, we
seek to address that matter in the wrong way. Should we send warships to
Somalia? We should send warships to the pirates who have attacked and seized
the economic zones and wealth of the Somalis and the food of their children.

I met the pirates, and I told them that I would negotiate an agreement between
them and the international community that respects the 200-mile exclusive
economic zone under the law of the sea, that protects all marine resources
belonging to the Somali people, and that stops all countries from disposing of
toxic waste along the Somali coast. In return, the Somalis would no longer
attack ships. We will propose and draft such an international treaty and submit
it to the General Assembly. That is the solution. The solution does not lie in
sending more military ships to fight the Somalis. That is not the solution. 

We are addressing the phenomena of piracy and terrorism in the wrong way. Today
there is swine flu. Perhaps tomorrow there will be fish flu, because sometimes
we produce viruses by controlling them. It is a commercial business. Capitalist
companies produce viruses so that they can generate and sell vaccinations. That
is very shameful and poor ethics. **Vaccinations and medicine should not be sold.
In The Green Book, I maintain that medicines should not be sold or subject to
commercialization. Medicines should be free of charge and vaccinations given
free to children, but capitalist companies produce the viruses and vaccinations
and want to make a profit.** Why are they not free of charge? We should give them
free of charge, and not sell them. The entire world should strive to protect
our people, create and manufacture vaccinations and give them free to children
and women, and not profit by them. All those items are on the agenda of the
General Assembly, which has only to exercise that duty.

The Ottawa Convention on Landmines forbids the production of landmines. That is
wrong. Landmines are defensive weapons. If I place them along the border of my
country and someone wants to invade me, they may be killed. That is all right,
because they are invading me. The Convention should be reconsidered. I am not
taking that defensive weapon to another country. The enemy is coming to me. On
the Al-Qadhafi website, I call for that treaty to be modified or annulled. This
treaty should be modified or annulled. I want to use anti-personnel mines to
defend my home against invasion. Eliminate weapons of mass destruction, not
landmines, which are defensive weapons.  With regard to the Palestinian
situation, the two-State solution is impossible; it is not practical.
Currently, these two States completely overlap. Partition is doomed to failure.
These two States are not neighbors; they are coextensive, in terms of both
population and geography. A buffer zone cannot be created between the two
States because there are half a million Israeli settlers in the West Bank and a
million Arab Palestinians in the territory known as Israel.

The solution is therefore a democratic State without religious fanaticism or
ethnicity. The generation of Sharon and Arafat is over. We need a new
generation, in which everyone can live in peace. Look at Palestinian and
Israeli youth; they both want peace and democracy, and they want to live under
one State. This conflict poisons the world.  The White Book actually has the
solution; I hold it here. The solution is Isratine. Arabs have no hostility or
animosity towards Israel. We are cousins and of the same race. We want to live
in peace. The refugees should go back.  You are the ones who brought the
Holocaust upon the Jews. You, not we, are the ones who burned them. We gave
them refuge. We gave them safe haven during the Roman era and the Arab reign in
Andalusia and during the rule of Hitler. You are the ones who poisoned them;
you are the ones who annihilated them. We provided them with protection. You
expelled them. Let us see the truth. We are not hostile; we are not enemies of
the Jews. And one day the Jews will need the Arabs. At that point, Arabs will
be the ones to give them protection, to save them, as we have done in the past.
Look at what everybody else did to the Jews. Hitler is an example. You are the
ones who hate the Jews, not us.

In brief, Kashmir should be an independent State, neither Indian nor Pakistani.
We must end that conflict. Kashmir should be a buffer State between India and
Pakistan.  With regard to Darfur, I truly hope that the assistance provided by
international organizations can be used for development projects, for
agriculture, for industry and for irrigation. You are the ones who made it a
crisis; you put it on the altar; you wanted to sacrifice Darfur so that you
could interfere in its internal affairs.

You have turned the Hariri problem into a United Nations problem. You are
selling Hariri’s corpse. You just want to settle scores with Syria. Lebanon is
an independent State; it has laws, courts, a judiciary and police. At this
stage, it is no longer the perpetrators that are being sought; the real wish is
to settle scores with Syria, not ensure justice for Hariri. The cases of Khalil
al-Wazir, Lumumba, Kennedy, and Hammarskjöld should also have been turned over
to the United Nations, if the Hariri case merits such attention.  The General
Assembly is now under the presidency of Libya. This is our right. Libya hopes
that you will assist in making the transition from a world fraught with crises
and tension to a world in which humanity, peace and tolerance prevail. I will
personally follow up on this issue with the General Assembly, President Treki
and the Secretary-General. It is not our habit to compromise when it comes to
the destiny of humanity and the struggles of the third world and the 100 small
nations, which should live in peace always.
