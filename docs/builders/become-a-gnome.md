# Becoming a Gnome Contributor

In gno.land, contributors are critical to everything—helping to build the
project and shape the ecosystem. Becoming a Gnome isn't just about coding or
submitting contributions; it's about joining a collaborative community where you
can hone your skills, share your ideas, innovate and make an impact in ways that
help gno.land grow and self-govern. This guide isn't a standard rulebook but
rather a helpful starting point to navigate your journey in the ecosystem, find
your own way to contribute and your own way to stand out.

## What Makes a Great Contributor?

The best contributors are self-starters and explorers. If you see something
that needs improvement, a problem you can solve (or want to solve), or an area
you'd like to explore, dive in! You don't need to wait for permission. Curiosity is
an asset - ask questions, experiment, and push boundaries to find better solutions.

Openness and implementation of feedback is also key. The most successful
contributors don't just accept feedback; they seek it out. Whether it's fully
documenting issues or pull requests, making the review process smoother benefits
everyone. Incorporating suggestions not only refines your work and helps you
improve, but makes it easier for others to collaborate. Providing details on
your logic or approach to the contribution, and its purpose and usefulness is
equally important.

Commitment makes a real difference in the goal of standing out as a Gnome.
Following through on tasks and being reliable keeps the momentum going. Quality
matters too as we are aiming for the highest standard for gno.land—thoughtful,
useful, and well-documented work is much easier to integrate and makes a stronger
impact in the ecosystem. Sticking to contributor
[submission guidelines](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
helps speed up reviews and get your contributions merged faster.

## Showcasing Your Work & Engaging with the Community

Making your contributions visible is equally important as making them. Start
by creating your own [gno.land namespace](../resources/gno-packages.md#package-path-structure)
to establish your identity, a [Hackerspace journey](https://github.com/gnolang/hackerspace/issues?q=sort:updated-desc%20is:issue%20is:open%20label:%22%F0%9F%8C%84%20journey%22)
to document your work, as well as a [Game of Realms](https://github.com/gnolang/game-of-realms) profile.

From there, you can start building your profile, starting with a
Home realm — your personal realm which can serve as your on-chain profile,
to document work, share updates, and use as a workspace. It doesn't have to be fancy;
it just needs to represent you. Check out some of the existing Home ealm examples
on the [Hall of Fame](https://gno.land/r/leon/hof).

Sharing progress is key. Whether it's a challenge you overcame, a cool discovery,
or a lesson learned, your updates help others and foster education to support a
stronger community. Getting involved in discussions, presenting ideas, and
collaborating with others will help build your presence and connections.

## Finding Your Own Way to Contribute

Not everyone's contributions look the same, and that's a good thing. If your
work isn't purely code-based—like research, conceptual development, or even
sketches—find creative ways to share it. Summaries, diagrams, or even photos
of notebooks can make your work more accessible to the community. If you prefer
asynchronous communication or face language barriers, don't let that stop you -
there are many ways to stay involved and illustrate your contributions.

Steps to Becoming a Gnome:

1. **Secure Your Namespace** – This is your unique identity in gno.land.
2. **Set Up Your Home Realm** – A space to organize and showcase your work.
3. **Build a Portfolio** – Document projects, achievements, and ongoing efforts in the Hackerspace repo and Game of Realms repo.
4. **Engage with the Community** – Share updates, join discussions, and collaborate.

## Stay True to Yourself

Your unique perspective, approach, and style are the foundation to making gno.land
special. Authenticity is key, but it's also important to ensure your contributions
are clear and accessible to others. By balancing individuality with effective
communication, you can grow as a contributor and leave a lasting impact.

Becoming a Gnome is a journey of learning, collaboration, and
creativity. By embracing these principles and finding ways to showcase your work,
you can help shape the future of gno.land while staying true to your own path.
