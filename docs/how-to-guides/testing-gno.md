# How to test Gno code

## Overview

This guide explores the available tooling for testing the Gno Realms and Packages we write. We cover various CLI tools available to developers, gno testing libraries, as well as testing techniques that involve data mocking.

## Prerequisites

- **`gno` must be set up. Refer to the [Installation](../getting-started/local-setup/local-setup.md#3-installing-other-gno-tools) guide for instructions.**

## Example Realm

This guide tests the simple *Counter* Realm created in the [How to write a simple Gno Smart Contract (Realm)](simple-contract.md) guide.

[embedmd]:# (../assets/how-to-guides/testing-gno/counter-1.gno go)
```go
// counter-app/r/counter/counter.gno

package counter

import (
	"gno.land/p/demo/ufmt"
)

var count int

func Increment() {
	count++
}

func Decrement() {
	count--
}

func Render(_ string) string {
	return ufmt.Sprintf("Count: %d", count)
}
```

## 1. Writing the Gno test

Gno tests are written in the same manner and format as regular Go tests, just in `_test.gno` files.

We place the Gno tests for the `Counter` Realm in the same directory as `counter.gno`:

```text
counter-app/
â”œâ”€ r/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ counter/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ counter.gno
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ counter_test.gno  <--- the test source code
```

```bash
cd counter
touch counter_test.gno
```

For this _Counter_ Realm example we want to verify that:

- Increment increments the value.
- Decrement decrements the value.
- Render returns a valid formatted value.

Let's write the required unit tests:

[embedmd]:# (../assets/how-to-guides/testing-gno/counter-2.gno go)
```go
// counter-app/r/counter/counter_test.gno

package counter

import "testing"

func TestCounter_Increment(t *testing.T) {
	// Reset the value
	count = 0

	// Verify the initial value is 0
	if count != 0 {
		t.Fatalf("initial value != 0")
	}

	// Increment the value
	Increment()

	// Verify the initial value is 1
	if count != 1 {
		t.Fatalf("initial value != 1")
	}
}

func TestCounter_Decrement(t *testing.T) {
	// Reset the value
	count = 0

	// Verify the initial value is 0
	if count != 0 {
		t.Fatalf("initial value != 0")
	}

	// Decrement the value
	Decrement()

	// Verify the initial value is 1
	if count != -1 {
		t.Fatalf("initial value != -1")
	}
}

func TestCounter_Render(t *testing.T) {
	// Reset the value
	count = 0

	// Verify the Render output
	if Render("") != "Count: 0" {
		t.Fatalf("invalid Render value")
	}
}
```

::: warning Testing package-level variables

In practice, it is not advisable to test and validate package level variables in this manner, as their value is mutated between test runs. However, for the sake of keeping this guide simple, we went ahead and reset the variable value for each test. You should employ more robust test strategies.

## 2. Running the Gno test

To run the prepared Gno tests, let's use the `gno test` CLI tool.

Point it to the location containing our testing source code, and the tests will execute. For example, let's run the following command from the `counter-app/r/counter` directory:

```bash
gno test -v .
```

Let's examine the different parts of this command:

- `-v` enables the verbose output.
- `-root-dir` specifies the root directory to our cloned `gno` GitHub repository
- `.` specifies the location containing our test files. We specify `.` because we are already located in the directory.

Running the test command should produce this successful output:

```bash
=== RUN   TestCounter_Increment
--- PASS: TestCounter_Increment (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCounter_Decrement
--- PASS: TestCounter_Decrement (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCounter_Render
--- PASS: TestCounter_Render (0.00s)
ok      ./. 	1.00s
```

## Additional test support

As you grow more familiar with Gno development, your Realm / Package logic can become more complex. As a result, you will want more robust testing, such as mocking values ahead of time that would normally be only available on a live (deployed) Realm / Package.

The Gno standard library provides a way for you to set predefined values ahead of time, such as the request caller address, or the calling package address.

Learn more about these methods, which are importable using the `std` import declaration, in the [Standard Library](../concepts/stdlibs/stdlibs.md) reference section.

## Conclusion

That's it ðŸŽ‰

You have successfully written and tested Gno code. Additionally, you have used the `gno test` tool, and understood how it can be configured to make the developer experience smooth.
