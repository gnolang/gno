# How to deploy a Realm / Package

## Overview

This guide shows you how to deploy any realm or package to the Gno chain. It will
show you how to:
- Deploy Gno code in your browser via the Playground, 
- Deploy Gno code from your local machine using `gnokey`'s `maketx addpkg` API.


## Deployment via the Playground

Deployment via the Playground is recommended for smaller realms and packages.
For larger projects, it is recommended to write, test, and deploy your code from
a local environment.
For this, check out [**Deployment from a local environment**](#deployment-from-a-local-environment).

### Prerequisites

- **Internet connection**
- **A keypair in a Gno.land wallet, such as [Adena](https://adena.app)**

### Using Gno Playground

You can write, test, and deploy packages and realms using Gno Playground.
To start using the Playground, you can check out XYZ.

For this example, we will be using the **Counter** realm. You can find the code
on [this Playground link](https://play.gno.land/p/iUWTha99D1J).

Once you have confirmed that the code is without bugs, you can click on "**Deploy**".
If your wallet is not connected, you will receive a prompt to connect it:

![DeployConnect](../assets/how-to-guides/deploy/deploy_connect.png)

After connecting your wallet to the Playground, you will be prompted with a 
new toolbox:

![DeployDefault](../assets/how-to-guides/deploy/deploy_default.png)

Here, you can choose the deployment path of your realm or package, as well as the network
to deploy to. You can also deploy to a local node from the Playground
if you are running one.

:::info
A few things to consider when deploying packages and realms:
- The **name** field in the path should match your package name, in this case `counter`
- Packages are usually deployed under `p/`, while realms are deployed under `r/`

An example path for the Counter realm could be the following: 
```go
gno.land/r/<your_username>/counter
```
:::

After choosing a path and network, you can click **Deploy**. This will prompt
a wallet pop-up asking you to sign the deployment transaction.

If all went well, you will have successfully deployed your the Counter package.
Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

You can check the status of your transaction by visiting the link displayed in the 
popup, such as [this one](https://gnoscan.io/transactions/details?txhash=q1YO2wV2n9nYfiT7mWqFd/FAUMvjAvDqYYxR5OpbRwQ=). 

## Deployment from a local environment

### Prerequisites

- **Have `gnokey` installed**
- **Have access to a `gnoland` node (local or remote)**
- **Have generated a keypair with `gnokey` & funded it with `gnot`**
- **Have a Realm or Package ready to deploy**

### Deploying

To illustrate deployment, we will use a realm. Consider the following folder
structure:

```
counter-app/
â”œâ”€ r/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ counter/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ counter.gno
```

We would like to deploy the realm found in `counter.gno`. To do this, open a
terminal at `counter-app/` and use the following `gnokey` command:

```bash
gnokey maketx addpkg \
--pkgpath "gno.land/r/demo/counter" \
--pkgdir "./r/counter" \
--gas-fee 10000000ugnot \
--gas-wanted 800000 \
--broadcast \
--chainid dev \
--remote localhost:26657 \
MyKey
```

Let's analyze all of the flags in detail:
- `--pkgpath` - path where the package/realm will be placed on-chain
- `--pkgdir` - local path where the package/realm is located
- `--gas-wanted` - the upper limit for units of gas for the execution of the 
transaction - similar to Solidity's gas limit
- `--gas-fee` - similar to Solidity's gas-price
- `--broadcast` - broadcast the transaction on-chain
- `--chain-id` - id of the chain to connect to - local or remote
- `--remote` - `gnoland` node endpoint - local or remote
- `MyKey` - the keypair to use for the transaction

:::info
As of October 2023, `--gas-fee` is fixed to 1gnot (10000000ugnot), with plans 
to change it down the line.
:::

Next, confirm the transaction with your keypair passphrase. If deployment was 
successful, you will be presented with a message similar to the following:

```
OK!
GAS WANTED: 800000
GAS USED:   775097
```
Depending on the size of the package/realm, you might need to increase amount 
given in the `--gas-wanted` flag to cover the deployment cost.

:::info
Regardless of whether you're deploying a realm or a package, you will be using 
`gnokey`'s `maketx addpkg` - the usage of `maketx addpkg` in both cases is identical.
To read more about the `maketx addpkg`
subcommand, view the `gnokey` [reference](../gno-tooling/cli/gnokey.md#addpkg).

## Conclusion

That's it ðŸŽ‰

You have now successfully deployed a realm/package to a Gno.land chain.
