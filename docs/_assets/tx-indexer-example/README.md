# tx-indexer Example Assets

This folder contains self‑contained example snippets referenced in the `docs/resources/indexing-gno.md` guide. They illustrate how to:

1. Start and interact with the official `tx-indexer` (GraphQL + JSON-RPC)
2. Query `BankMsgSend` (GNOT transfer) transactions via GraphQL
3. Parse transaction JSON into typed Go structs (idiomatic `json.Unmarshal` usage)
4. Sort and display largest transfers
5. Subscribe to real‑time transactions over GraphQL WebSocket
6. Expose a minimal HTTP stats endpoint
7. Persist transactions with SQLite (demo persistence layer)

Use these snippets as a learning aid or a starting point for building dashboards, analytics pipelines, or monitoring tools on top of Gno.land.

Nothing here is production‑ready; error handling, security, pagination, retries, and batching are intentionally simplified for clarity.
