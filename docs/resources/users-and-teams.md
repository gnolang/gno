# Users and Teams in gno.land

## User Registration

In gno.land, users can register a unique username that:
- Provides a more readable identity than a blockchain address
- Grants the exclusive right to deploy code under that namespace
- Can be used in social contexts across the ecosystem

### Registration Process

To register a username:

1. Visit the user registry realm at [`gno.land/r/gnoland/users`](https://gno.land/r/gnoland/users)
2. Check if your desired username is available by 
3. Register using the following command:

```bash
gnokey maketx call \
  --pkgpath "gno.land/r/gnoland/users/v1" \
  --func "Register" \
  --args "YOUR_USERNAME" \
  --gas-fee 1000000ugnot \
  --gas-wanted 2000000 \
  --send "1000000ugnot" \
  --remote https://rpc.gno.land:443 \
  --chainid portal-loop \
  YOUR_KEY_NAME
```

The registration costs 1 GNOT, which serves as an anti-spam measure and ensures users value their identities.

## Username Ownership

Once registered, a username is permanently linked to the registering address. This address:

- Has exclusive rights to deploy packages under that namespace
- Can manage that username's profile and
<!-- - XXX: Can transfer ownership, when we decide how we want to propose this -->

### Namespace Access

Your registered username becomes an exclusive namespace where you can deploy both realms and pure packages:

```
gno.land/p/YOUR_USERNAME/...  # Pure packages
gno.land/r/YOUR_USERNAME/...  # Realms
```

For example, a user with the username "alice" could deploy:
- `gno.land/r/alice/blog` - A personal blog realm
- `gno.land/p/alice/utils` - A utility package

Only the address that registered the username can deploy to these paths, ensuring security and preventing impersonation.

## Teams and Collaborative Development

There is an ongoing effort on team-based development through shared namespaces. This feature will enable:

1. Multiple addresses with permission to deploy under a team namespace
2. Role-based access control for team members
3. Collaborative development of larger projects

Until full team support is available, collaborative development can be achieved through:

1. **Account sharing** - Multiple developers using the same key (not recommended for security reasons)
2. **Multi-signature wallets** - Using multi-sig wallets to control deployment to a shared namespace
3. **Development on branches** - Developing under individual namespaces and then migrating to a main namespace

## Public Anonymous Namespaces

In addition to registered usernames, all addresses can deploy under their own address-based namespace:

```
gno.land/p/g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5/...
gno.land/r/g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5/...
```

This allows for permissionless deployment even without a registered username, though these long namespaces are less user-friendly.
