#  Working with realms 

Gno.land Realms are Packages of Gno code that are identified by their "package
paths" and are also "addressable" into an [Address](./gno-stdlibs.md#address)
which has prefix "g1...".

A Realm is created when a Gno code Package is added to "gno.land/r/...", and
the state of realm packages are mutated by signed function call messages from
users calling exposed functions of realms. Realm functions can in turn call
other functions creating a call stack beginning at origin with a user Account.

A "P" Package is created when a Package is added to "gno.land/p/...". "P"
Packages are immutable and cannot be modified by any message after creation.

Ephemeral packages are created when users execute "gno.land/e/..." paths using
`gnokey maketx run`. These are temporary, user-executed code that run in the
user's realm context and are not stored on-chain. Ephemeral packages can be 
seen as an extension of the user realm. This means that all checks, such
as [`realm.IsUser()`](./gno-stdlibs.md#isuser), will return the same values for 
the user realm or the corresponding ephemeral package.

Realm and "P" Packages have an Account and Address derived from its package
path. Users too have an Account and Address determined cryptographically from a
BIP39 mnemonic phrase or secret.

Realms and users can both send and receive [Coins](./gno-stdlibs.md#coin) using
the [Banker](./gno-stdlibs.md#banker) module by Address.

Realms are represented by a `Realm` type in Gno:

```go
type Realm struct {
    addr    Address // Gno address in the bech32 format
    pkgPath string  // realm's path on-chain
}
```

The full Realm API can be found under the
[reference section](./gno-stdlibs.md#realm).

### Code Realms

Often simply called `realms`, Gno smart contracts contain Gno code and exist
on-chain at a specific [package path](gno-packages.md). A package path is the
defining identifier of a realm, while its address is derived from it.

As opposed to [pure packages](./gno-packages.md#pure-packages-p), realms are
stateful, meaning they keep their state between transaction calls. In practice,
global variables used in realms are automatically persisted after a transaction
has been executed. Thanks to this, Gno developers do not need to bother with the
intricacies of state management and persistence, like they do with other
languages.

### Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)

EOAs, or simply `user realms`, are Gno addresses generated from a BIP39 mnemonic
phrase in a key management application, such as
[gnokey](../users/interact-with-gnokey.md), and web wallets, such as
[Adena](../users/third-party-wallets.md).

Currently, EOAs are the only realms that can initiate a transaction. They can do
this by calling any of the possible messages in gno.land, which can be
found [here](../users/interact-with-gnokey.md#making-transactions).

### Working with Realms

Every Gno transaction produces a call stack that can switch across functions
declared in realm packages and functions declared in p packages. The `std`
package contains functions that return the current realm, previous realm, and
the origin caller's address. 

:::info

In this demo, we consider that all functions called
are [crossing](./gno-interrealm.md).
:::

- `std.OriginCaller()` - returns the address of the original signer of the
  transaction
- `std.PreviousRealm()` - returns the previous realm instance, which can be a user 
  realm or a smart contract realm
- `std.CurrentRealm()` - returns the instance of the realm that has called it

Let's look at the return values of these functions in two distinct situations:
1. User realm calling a code realm
2. User realm calling a sequence of code realms

#### 1. User realm calling a realm

When an User realm calls a code realm, the call stack is initiated by the user 
realm, and the realm stack crosses from the user realm to the code realm, which 
becomes the current execution context.

Take these two actors in the call stack:
```
User realm:
    addr: `g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5`
    pkgPath: "" // empty as this is a user realm

Realm A:
    addr:    `g17m4ga9t9dxn8uf06p3cahdavzfexe33ecg8v2s`
    pkgPath: `gno.land/r/demo/users`

        ┌─────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │         EOA         │      │         Realm A         │
        │                     │      │                         │
        │  addr:              │      │  addr:                  │
        │  g1jg...sqf5        ├──────►  g17m...8v2s            │
        │                     │      │                         │
        │  pkgPath:           │      │  pkgPath:               │
        │  ""                 │      │  gno.land/r/demo/users  │
        └─────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────────┘
```

Let's look at return values for each of the methods, called from within
`Realm A`, assuming a realm cross is happening:
```
std.OriginCaller() => `g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5`
std.PreviousRealm() => Realm {
    addr:    `g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5`
    pkgPath: ``
}
std.CurrentRealm() => Realm {
    addr:    `g17m4ga9t9dxn8uf06p3cahdavzfexe33ecg8v2s`
    pkgPath: `gno.land/r/demo/users`
}
```

#### 2. User realm calling a sequence of realms

Assuming that you use realm crossing functions, when a user realm calls a 
sequence of realms, the call stack transitions through multiple realms. Each 
realm in the sequence becomes the current context as the call progresses.

Take these three actors in the call stack:
```
User realm:
    addr: g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5
    pkgPath: "" // empty as this is a user realm

Realm A:
    addr: g1dvqd8qgvavqayxklzfdmccd2eps263p43pu2c6
    pkgPath: gno.land/r/demo/a

Realm B:
    addr: g1rsk9cwv034cw3s6csjeun2jqypj0ztpecqcm3v
    pkgPath: gno.land/r/demo/b

┌─────────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────┐
│         EOA         │   │       Realm A        │   │       Realm B       │
│                     │   │                      │   │                     │
│  addr:              │   │  addr:               │   │  addr:              │
│  g1jg...sqf5        ├───►  g17m...8v2s         ├───►  g1rs...cm3v        │
│                     │   │                      │   │                     │
│  pkgPath:           │   │  pkgPath:            │   │  pkgPath:           │
│  ""                 │   │  gno.land/r/demo/a   │   │  gno.land/r/demo/b  │
└─────────────────────┘   └──────────────────────┘   └─────────────────────┘
```

Depending on which realm the methods are called in, the values will change. For
`Realm A`:
```
std.OriginCaller() => `g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5`
std.PreviousRealm() => Realm {
    addr:    `g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5`
    pkgPath: ``
}
std.CurrentRealm() => Realm {
    addr:    `g1dvqd8qgvavqayxklzfdmccd2eps263p43pu2c6`
    pkgPath: `gno.land/r/demo/a`
}
```

For `Realm B`:
```
std.OriginCaller() => `g1jg8mtutu9khhfwc4nxmuhcpftf0pajdhfvsqf5`
std.PreviousRealm() => Realm {
    addr:    `g1dvqd8qgvavqayxklzfdmccd2eps263p43pu2c6`
    pkgPath: `gno.land/r/demo/a`
}
std.CurrentRealm() => Realm {
    addr:    `g1rsk9cwv034cw3s6csjeun2jqypj0ztpecqcm3v`
    pkgPath: `gno.land/r/demo/b`
}
```
