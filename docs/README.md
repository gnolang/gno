# Gno.land

Welcome to the official documentation of Gno.land.

Gno.land is a smart contract platform built on a novel interpretation of Go
(Golang) for blockchain, created to enable powerful, modular, and secure
decentralized applications with a minimalist approach and excellent developer
experience.
