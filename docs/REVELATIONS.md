# Of Decentralized Coordination, and Christ.

The BFT byzantine generals problem is a problem of coordination in the face of
lying/colluding adversaries.  Whether PoW or by classical BFT, a key ingredient
to decentralized coordination is an external catalyst -- a measure of time.
In PoW it is randomness afforded by the universe.  In BFT PoS it is the timing
of external events, among other things.

Lamport's research and others have shown that another key ingredient is
encryption.  It is still possible for the Byzantine generals to coordinate an
attack without encryption, but the process is necessarily complicated and
inefficent.  It is much easier to coordinate an attack when the generals can
communicate securely.  The outcome of WW2 was in part determined by the
breaking of the Enigma cipher, for example.

Here is what some of us see, and maybe you will too: thousands of years ago,
some very wise people figured out through divine revelation the ability to
predict two things with exceptional accuracy: (1) the movement of the stars and
planets, and (2) and the evolution of an ecosystem of cultures.  They knew more
or less the kind of conflicts we would be experiencing today.  They didn't know
everything, but they knew enough to predict that around this time of the
millenium there would be a great reckoning between different paradigms, and
they called this good versus evil, light versus darkness, the Son of God vs
Satan, the Morning Star vs Saturn.

The light is truth, while the darkness is the lack of, or occlusion of truth.    // sometimes too much truth can temporarily occlude other truths
The former shares information and operates in the paradigm of honesty, honor,
and transparency.  The latter gets its strength by taking it from the light, by
lying, manipulating, and hiding the truth.  The Son of God promotes healthy
relationships and offers empathy and forgiveness (each new image a chance),
while Saturn sacrifices and devours its own children.  Jesus wants all those
who deserve by virtue of having the right mentality, and by consequence those
who act honorably for the right reasons, to be saved, while S66.Satan.com won't  // who mocks us to confuse us -- vav vav vav -- by proxy social-engineering and subtle suggestions from peers, aka mind-control.
let you buy a gun to defend yourself until you get the blessing that never       // see bill S66+S67 proposed by Sen. Feinstein in context.
comes.

The people who knew the stars and knew the dual nature of mortal men, the
Father who looked after the Son and the rightful Spirit also knew what would
happen in the heavens on September 23rd, 2017:
REV 12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the
sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars
REV 12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be
delivered.  And heard a loud voice saying in heaven,
REV 12:10 Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and
the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which
accused them before our God day and night.

Today is 1260 days after the fulfillment of the prophesy REV 12:1 as written by
John, and soon it will be 3.5 years (1 year + 2 years + 0.5 year) since.  The
three wise sages followed their star as prophesied for them, and found their
savior.  That savior then devised a plan to save us today from the darkness by
encoding encrypted instructions for our decentralized coordination.

With Christ as my Father and savior, and all of us under God, we have witnessed
the truth in the image of the Revelations with the help of the words of the
Quran, and We hereby proclaim to the world to hear the singular message.  The
spirit of the people will not be subdued, and we see through your attempts to
divide and us. Let everyone of all origins who know come together and establish
the new world of Christ.  Reveal your secrets and re-reform, before you are
cast into the firey brimstone.

Say it with us (when you feel is right),

NOW IS COME SALVATION,
AND STRENGTH,
AND THE KINGDOM OF OUR GOD,
AND THE POWER OF HIS CHRIST.

If you don't Gno, now you Gno.

## NOTES

Run simulators yourself and compare with dates across the previous and future
thousands of years, and find the best match.  Remove cloth of the sun to reveal
the truth for yourself.  LMK what you find :)

Right after the above video, Twttr serves this:
https://youtube.com/watch?v=C_mQMmltAb4 ; there are many theories, think for
yourself.  The truth is, your subjective truth is what counts here; and that's
why prophesies work.  (Israel shines bright.  We want the best for all peoples,
for all to have their land.)

A prophesy is in part, the proposition of a Focal Point (catalyst) in a
decentralized coordination algorithm, where the threshold tolerance against
Byzantine actors is n-2.

How many non-Byzantine actors can successfully coordinate depends chiefly on
the quality of the Focal Point.  It doesn't matter how irrational or silly the
framework is; the more people subscribe, the greater the coordination.

Here you can introduce logic even into cosmology.
