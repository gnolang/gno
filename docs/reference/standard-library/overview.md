# Overview

This section serves as a reference to the standard libraries available in Gno.

Gno is designed to offer features similar to those in Golang. Therefore, this documentation
does not include in-depth references for libraries that have identical implementation details
as those in Golang. If a standard library differs in any way from its usage or implementation in Golang,
it will be documented in this section.
