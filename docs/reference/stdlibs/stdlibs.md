# Standard Libraries

This section serves as a reference to the standard libraries available in Gno.

Gno is designed to offer features similar to those in Go. Therefore, this documentation
does not include in-depth references for libraries that have identical implementation details
as those in Go. If a standard library differs in any way from its usage or implementation in Go,
it will be documented in this section.
