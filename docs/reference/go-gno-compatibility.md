Generics are currently not implemented.

Note that Gno does not support shadowing of built-in types. 
While the following built-in typecasting assignment would work in Go, this is not supported in Gno.

```go
rune := rune('a')
```

## Stdlibs

Legend:

* `nondet`: the standard library in question would require non-deterministic
  behaviour to implement as in Go, such as cryptographical randomness or
  os/network access. The library may still be implemented at one point, with a
  different API.
* `gospec`: the standard library is very Go-specific -- for instance, it is used
  for debugging information or for parsing/build Go source code. A Gno version
  may exist at one point, likely with a different package name or semantics.
* `gnics`: the standard library requires generics.
* `test`: the standard library is currently available for use exclusively in
  test contexts, and may have limited functionality.
* `cmd`: the Go standard library is a command -- a direct equivalent in Gno
  would not be useful.
* `tbd`: whether to include the standard library or not is still up for
  discussion.
* `todo`: the standard library is to be added, and
  [contributions are welcome.](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/1267)
* `part`: the standard library is partially implemented in Gno, and contributions are
  welcome to add the missing functionality.
* `full`: the standard library is fully implemented in Gno.

[^1]: `builtin` is a "fake" package that exists to document the behaviour of
  some builtin functions. The "fake" package does not currently exist in Gno,
  but [all functions up to Go 1.17 exist](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin@go1.17),
  except for those relating to complex or channel types.
[^2]: `crypto/sha1` and `crypto/md5` implement "deprecated" hashing
  algorithms, widely considered unsafe for cryptographic hashing. Decision on
  whether to include these as part of the official standard libraries is still
  pending.
[^3]: `crypto/sha256` is currently only implemented for `Sum256`, which should
  still cover a majority of use cases. A full implementation is welcome.
[^4]: like many other encoding packages, `fmt` depends on `reflect` to be added.
  For now, package `gno.land/p/demo/ufmt` may do what you need. In test
  functions, `fmt` works.
[^5]: `io/ioutil` [is deprecated in Go.](https://pkg.go.dev/io/ioutil)
  Its functionality has been moved to packages `os` and `io`. The functions
  which have been moved in `io` are implemented in that package.
[^6]: `sort` has the notable omission of `sort.Slice`. You'll need to write a
  bit of boilerplate, but you can use `sort.Interface` + `sort.Sort`!
[^7]: `time.Now` returns the block time rather than the system time, for
  determinism. Concurrent functionality (such as `time.Ticker`) is not implemented.
