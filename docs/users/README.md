In this section, you will learn how to use the `gnokey` binary. `gnokey` is the
gno.land CLI keychain and client, and it allows you to do 4 main things:
- Manage Gno key pairs
- Send state-changing calls (transactions)
- Query a gno.land network
- Sign and broadcast transactions with [airgap protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking))

Check out the rest of this section to learn how to do all of these.
