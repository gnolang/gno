# Discover Gno.land

Gno.land provides various ways to interact with the blockchain, from browsing
the deployed smart contracts (called realms) to interacting with them through
transactions. Here's how you can get started:

### Exploring with gnoweb

[gnoweb](./explore-with-gnoweb.md) is the built-in web interface for exploring
the Gno.land blockchain. It allows you to:
- Browse deployed realms and packages
- View source code of any contract
- See rendered content from realms

gnoweb is your window into the on-chain activity and provides a friendly way to
discover what's available on Gno.land.

### Using a Wallet

To interact with Gno.land (sending transactions, deploying contracts, etc.),
you'll need a wallet:

- [gnokey](./interact-with-gnokey.md) - The official command-line wallet for Gno.land
- [Third-party wallets](./third-party-wallets.md) - Browser extensions and other wallet options

## The Gno.land Ecosystem

Gno.land is not limited to a single blockchain but is designed to become an
ecosystem of chains powered by the Gno language. The current networks focus on
testing and development, but the vision extends to a vibrant ecosystem of
interconnected chains and applications.
