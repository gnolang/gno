# Using an External Wallet on Gno.land

While Gno.land provides its own command-line wallet (`gnokey`), you may prefer
using a more user-friendly browser extension or mobile wallet. This page covers
available third-party wallets that support Gno.land networks.

## GnoConnect Integration

Gno.land uses GnoConnect, a protocol that allows external wallets to integrate
with gno-powered blockchains. This provides a standardized way for wallets to:

- Connect to Gno.land networks
- Sign and broadcast transactions
- Interact with smart contracts (realms)
- Manage your GNOT and tokens

## Compatible Wallets

- [Adena](https://adena.app) is a browser extension wallet specifically designed
  for Gno.land. It's the most feature-complete wallet currently available.

## Choosing a Wallet

When selecting a wallet, consider these factors:

- **Security:** Has the wallet been audited? What security practices do they follow?
- **Features:** Does it support all the functions you need?
- **User Experience:** Is it easy to use and understand?
- **Maintenance:** Is it actively maintained and updated?

For beginners, we recommend starting with Adena as it provides the most complete
support for Gno.land features and has undergone security audits.

## Getting Started

To get started with an external wallet:

1. Install your chosen wallet extension or app
2. Create a new account or import an existing one
3. Configure the wallet to connect to your desired Gno.land network
4. Get some testnet GNOT from the [Faucet Hub](https://faucet.gno.land)

You're now ready to interact with Gno.land through your wallet!
