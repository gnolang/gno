# Becoming a gno.land Power User

Ready to take your gno.land journey to the next level? This guide collects
resources, tools, and communities for users who want to dive deeper into the
gno.land ecosystem.

## Establishing Your Identity

To get the most out of gno.land, consider registering a unique username:

1. A username provides a more human-readable identity than a blockchain address
2. It gives you exclusive rights to deploy code under that namespace
3. It improves your experience across various dApps in the ecosystem

For detailed instructions on registering a username and understanding
namespaces, see the [Users and Teams](../resources/users-and-teams.md)
documentation.
