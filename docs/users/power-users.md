# Becoming a Gno.land Power User

Ready to take your Gno.land journey to the next level? This guide collects
resources, tools, and communities for users who want to dive deeper into the
Gno.land ecosystem.

## Establishing Your Identity

To get the most out of Gno.land, consider registering a unique username:

1. A username provides a more human-readable identity than a blockchain address
2. It gives you exclusive rights to deploy code under that namespace
3. It improves your experience across various dApps in the ecosystem

For detailed instructions on registering a username and understanding
namespaces, see the [Users and Teams](../resources/users-and-teams.md)
documentation.

## Transitioning from User to Builder

Ready to contribute? Here are pathways to level up your involvement:

1. **Building dApps** - Create your own applications on Gno.land
2. **Contributing to Core** - Help improve the Gno language and tools
3. **Creating Tools** - Build supporting infrastructure for the ecosystem
4. **Documentation** - Help improve these docs and educational content
5. **Community Building** - Organize events or create content

Check out the [Become a Gnome](../builders/become-a-gnome.md) guide for more
details on contributing to the ecosystem.

comfortable with Gno.land, consider how you can help shape its future!
