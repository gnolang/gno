# Coin

A Coin is a native Gno type that has a denomination and an amount. Coins can be issued by the [Banker](banker.md).  

A coin is defined by the following:

```go
type Coin struct {
	Denom  string `json:"denom"`
	Amount int64  `json:"amount"`
}
```

`Denom` is the denomination of the coin, i.e. `ugnot`, and `Amount` is a non-negative
amount of the coin.

Multiple coins can be bundled together into a `Coins` slice:

```go
type Coins []Coin
```

This slice behaves like a mathematical set - it cannot contain duplicate `Coin` instances.

The `Coins` slice can be included in a transaction made by a user addresses or a realm. 
Coins in this set are then available for access by specific types of Bankers,
which can manipulate them depending on access rights.
