# Overview

Gno comes with a set of standard libraries which are included to ease development and provide extended functionality to the language. These include:
- standard libraries as we know them in classic Go, i.e. `encoding/binary`, `strings`, `testing`, etc.
- a special `std` package, which contains types, interfaces, and APIs created to handle blockchain-related functionality.


Standard libraries differ from on-chain packages in terms of their import path structure.
Unlike on-chain [packages](../packages.md), standard libraries do not incorporate a domain-like format at the beginning
of their import path. For example:
- `import "encoding/binary"` refers to a standard library
- `import "gno.land/p/demo/avl"` refers to an on-chain package.

To see concrete implementation details & API references, see the [reference](../../reference/standard-library/overview.md) section.

## Accessing documentation

Apart from the official documentation you are currently reading, you can also access documentation for the standard
libraries in several other different ways. You can obtain a list of all the available standard libraries with the following commands:

```console
$ cd gnovm/stdlibs # go to correct directory

$ find -type d
./testing
./math
./crypto
./crypto/chacha20
./crypto/chacha20/chacha
./crypto/chacha20/rand
./crypto/sha256
./crypto/cipher
...
```

All the packages have automatically generated documentation through the use of the
`gno doc` command, which has similar functionality and features to `go doc`:

```console
$ gno doc encoding/binary
package binary // import "encoding/binary"

Package binary implements simple translation between numbers and byte sequences
and encoding and decoding of varints.

[...]

var BigEndian bigEndian
var LittleEndian littleEndian
type AppendByteOrder interface{ ... }
type ByteOrder interface{ ... }
$ gno doc -u -src encoding/binary littleEndian.AppendUint16
package binary // import "encoding/binary"

func (littleEndian) AppendUint16(b []byte, v uint16) []byte {
        return append(b,
                byte(v),
                byte(v>>8),
        )
}
```

`gno doc` will work automatically when used within the Gno repository or any
repository which has a `go.mod` dependency on `github.com/gnolang/gno`.

Another alternative is setting your environment variable `GNOROOT` to point to
where you cloned the Gno repository.

```sh
export GNOROOT=$HOME/gno
```
