# Portal Loop

Portal Loop is an always-up-to-date staging testnet that allows for using
the latest version of Gno, Gno.land, and TM2. By utilizing the power of Docker
& the [tx-archive](https://github.com/gnolang/tx-archive) tool, the Portal Loop can run the latest code from the 
master branch on the [Gno monorepo](https://github.com/gnolang/gno), 
while preserving most/all the previous the transaction data. 

The Portal Loop allows for quick iteration on the latest version of Gno - without
having to make a hard/soft fork. 

Below is a diagram demonstrating how the Portal Loop works:
```

## Using the Portal Loop

The Portal Loop deployment can be found at [gno.land](https://gno.land), while
the exposed RPC endpoints can be found on `https://rpc.gno.land:443`. The RPC endpoint
list can be found in the [reference section](../reference/rpc-endpoints.md).

### A warning note

While allowing for quick iteration on the most up-to-date software, the Portal Loop
has some drawbacks:
- If a breaking change happens on `master`, transactions that used the previous version of
Gno will fail to be replayed, meaning **data will be lost**. 
- Since transactions are archived and replayed during genesis, 
block height & timestamp cannot be relied upon.
