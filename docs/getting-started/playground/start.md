# Gno Playground

## Overview

The Gno Playground is a web editor and sandbox that enables developers to 
interactively work with the Gno language. It makes coding, testing,
and deploying simple with its diverse set of tools and features. Users can
share code, run tests, and deploy projects to Gno.land networks, 
making it the perfect tool to get started with Gno development.

## Prerequisites

- **Internet connection**
- **A keypair in a Gno.land wallet, such as [Adena](https://adena.app)**

To fully utilize Playground features, you will need to install a Gno.land web
browser wallet, such as [Adena](https://www.adena.app/), and create a keypair. This will allow you to
interact with the Playground.

## Playground Features

To get started, visit the Playground at [play.gno.land](https://play.gno.land). You will be greeted with a
simple `package.gno` file:
