# Gno Playground

## Overview

The Gno Playground is a web editor and sandbox that enables developers to 
interactively work with the Gno language. It makes coding, testing,
and deploying simple with its diverse set of tools and features. Users can
share code, run tests, and deploy projects to Gno.land networks, 
making it the perfect tool to get started with Gno development.

## Prerequisites

- **Internet connection**
- **A keypair in a Gno.land wallet, such as [Adena](https://adena.app)**

To fully utilize Playground features, you will need to install a Gno.land web
browser wallet, such as [Adena](https://www.adena.app/), and create a keypair. This will allow you to
interact with the Playground.

## Playground Features

To get started, visit the Playground at [play.gno.land](https://play.gno.land). You will be greeted with a
simple `package.gno` file:

The Playground has the following features:
- `Share` - Get a permanent, shareable link to the code currently found in the playground
- `Deploy` - Connect your wallet and deploy your code to a Gno.land network
- `Format` - Format your Gno code
- `Run` - Run a specific expression on your code
- `Test` - Run tests on your code
- `REPL` - Experiment and troubleshoot in real-time using the GnoVM with
interactive REPL features (experimental)

Let's dive into each of the Playground features.

### Share

This feature allows users to get a permanent shortlink to the code found in the
playground at the time of clicking. This way, Gno code can be shared easily. 

### Deploy

Deploy allows users to quickly deploy their Gno code to the chain. After connecting 
a Gno.land wallet, users will be able to choose which package path to deploy to,
as well as which network.

After inputting your desired [package path, 

### Format
Format will simply format your code, using `gofmt`.

### Run
Run will allow you to run an expression on your Gno code.



### Test

### REPL
