# Interacting with Gno.land code

## Overview
In this tutorial, you will learn how to interact with Gno.land code.
You will understand how to use your keypair to send transactions to realms
and packages, send native coins, and more.

## Prerequisites
- **`gnokey` installed.** Reference the
[Local Setup](installation.md#3-installing-other-gno-tools) guide for steps
- **A keypair in `gnokey`.** Reference the 
[Working with Key Pairs](working-with-key-pairs.md#adding-a-private-key-using-a-mnemonic) guide for steps

## 1. Get testnet GNOTs
For interacting with any Gno.land chain, you will need a certain amount of GNOTs
to pay gas fees with. 

For this example, we will use the [Portal Loop](../../concepts/testnets.md#portal-loop) 
testnet. We can access the Portal Loop faucet by visiting its
[faucet page](https://gno.land/faucet). Here, you can input your Gno address and receive testnet GNOTs.

## 2. Visit a realm
For this example, we will use the GNOT wrapper realm. This realm can be found on
[gno.land/r/demo/wugnot](https://gno.land/r/demo/wugnot), and serves the purpose
of wrapping native GNOTs into a GRC20 standard token.
