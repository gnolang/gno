# Setting up a Local Chain

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to start a local Gno node (and chain!).
Additionally, you will see the different options you can use to make your Gno instance unique.

## Prerequisites

- [`gnoland` installed](local-setup.md#3-installing-other-gno-tools).

## Starting a node with a default configuration

You can start a Gno blockchain node with the default configuration by navigating to the `gno.land` sub-folder and
running the following command:

```bash
gnoland start
```

The command will trigger a chain initialization process (if you haven't run the node before), and start the Gno node,
which is ready to accept transactions and interact with other Gno nodes.

To view the command defaults, simply run the `help` command:

```bash
gnoland start --help
```

Let's break down the most important default settings:

- `chainid` - the ID of the Gno chain. This is used for Gno clients, and distinguishing the chain from other Gno
  chains (ex. through IBC)
- `config` - the custom node configuration file
  for more details on utilizing this file
- `genesis-balances-file` - the initial premine balances file, which contains initial native currency allocations for
  the chain. By default, the genesis balances file is located in `gno.land/genesis/genesis_balances.txt`, this is also the
  reason why we need to navigate to the `gno.land` sub-folder to run the command with default settings
- `root-dir` - the working directory for the node configuration and node data (state DB)

:::info Resetting the chain

As mentioned, the working directory for the node is located in `root-dir`. To reset the chain, you need
to delete this directory and start the node up again. If you are using the default node configuration, you can run
`make fclean` from the `gno.land` sub-folder to delete the `tempdir` working directory.

## Changing the chain ID

:::info Changing the Gno chain ID has several implications

- It affects how the Gno node communicates with other Gno nodes / chains
- Gno clients that communicate through JSON-RPC need to match this value

It's important to configure your node properly before launching it in a distributed network.
Keep in mind that changes may not be applicable once connected.

:::

To change the Gno chain ID, run the following command:

```bash
gnoland start --chainid NewChainID
```

We can verify the chain ID has been changed, by fetching the status of the node and seeing the
associated chain ID. By default, the node exposes the JSON-RPC API on `http://127.0.0.1:26657`:

```bash
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "status",
    "params": [],
    "id": 1
}' 'http://127.0.0.1:26657'
```

We should get a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "node_info": {
      "version_set": [
        // ...
      ],
      "net_address": "g10g9r37g9xa54a6clttzmhk2gmdkzsntzty0cvr@0.0.0.0:26656",
      "network": "NewChainID"
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

:::danger Chain ID can be set only once

Since the chain ID information is something bound to a chain, you can
only change it once upon chain initialization, and further attempts to change it will
have no effect.

## Changing the node configuration

You can specify a node configuration file using the `--config` flag.

```bash
gnoland start --config config.toml
```

## Changing the premine list

You do not need to use the `gno.land/genesis/genesis_balances.txt` file as the source of truth for initial network
funds.

To specify a custom balance sheet for a fresh local chain, you can use the `-genesis-balances-file`:

```bash
gnoland start -genesis-balances-file custom-balances.txt
```

Make sure the balances file follows the following format:

```text
<address>=<balance>ugnot
```

Following this pattern, potential entries into the genesis balances file would look like:

```text
g1qpymzwx4l4cy6cerdyajp9ksvjsf20rk5y9rtt=10000000000ugnot
g1u7y667z64x2h7vc6fmpcprgey4ck233jaww9zq=10000000000ugnot
```
