# overflow

Check for int/int8/int16/int64/int32 integer overflow in Golang arithmetic.

Forked from https://github.com/JohnCGriffin/overflow

### Install
```
go get github.com/johncgriffin/overflow
```
Note that because Go has no template types, the majority of repetitive code is 
generated by overflow_template.sh.  If you have to change an
algorithm, change it there and regenerate the Go code via:
```
go generate
```
### Synopsis

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "math"
import "github.com/JohnCGriffin/overflow"

func main() {

	addend := math.MaxInt64 - 5

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		sum, ok := overflow.Add(addend, i)
		fmt.Printf("%v+%v -> (%v,%v)\n",
			addend, i, sum, ok)
	}

}
```
yields the output
```
9223372036854775802+0 -> (9223372036854775802,true)
9223372036854775802+1 -> (9223372036854775803,true)
9223372036854775802+2 -> (9223372036854775804,true)
9223372036854775802+3 -> (9223372036854775805,true)
9223372036854775802+4 -> (9223372036854775806,true)
9223372036854775802+5 -> (9223372036854775807,true)
9223372036854775802+6 -> (0,false)
9223372036854775802+7 -> (0,false)
9223372036854775802+8 -> (0,false)
9223372036854775802+9 -> (0,false)
```

For int, int64, and int32 types, provide Add, Add32, Add64, Sub, Sub32, Sub64, etc.  
Unsigned types not covered at the moment, but such additions are welcome.

### Stay calm and panic

There's a good case to be made that a panic is an unidiomatic but proper response.  Iff you
believe that there's no valid way to continue your program after math goes wayward, you can
use the easier Addp, Mulp, Subp, and Divp versions which return the normal result or panic.
