# bptree — Immutable B+ Tree for Gno

A drop-in replacement for `tm2/pkg/iavl`, implementing a versioned,
persistent B+ tree with ICS23 merkle proofs.

## Why replace IAVL?

IAVL is a binary AVL+ tree. Every read traverses ~28 levels for 100M
items. Every write COW-clones ~28 nodes. The B+ tree with branching
factor 32 reduces this to ~6 levels — fewer disk reads, fewer writes,
fewer round-trips to the underlying KV store.

| Metric (100M items, 10K cache) | IAVL | B+32 |
|---|---|---|
| GET disk reads | 15 | 3 |
| SET disk writes | 28 | 7 |
| SET total ops | 43 | 10 |
| Proof size | ~1.4 KB | ~1.0 KB |

See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for full analysis across tree
sizes, cache configurations, and batched workloads.

## Design choices

### Branching factor B=32

A compile-time constant. Each inner node holds up to 31 separator keys
and 32 child references. Each leaf holds up to 32 key-value pairs.
The value 32 balances:
- **Read performance**: tree height is log₃₂(n) ≈ 6 for 100M items
- **Write amplification**: each COW'd node is ~1.7KB (vs IAVL's ~100B)
- **Proof size**: log₂(32)=5 mini-merkle siblings per tree level
- **Cache efficiency**: 10K nodes × ~4.3KB ≈ 43MB caches all inner nodes up to ~200M items

### Out-of-line values

Leaf nodes store `key + SHA256(value)`, not the raw value. Values are
stored separately in the DB, content-addressed by their SHA256 hash.
This means:
- **Smaller nodes**: leaf nodes are ~1.4KB regardless of value size
- **Less COW amplification**: modifying one key copies only hash references, not sibling values
- **Deduplication**: identical values stored once (content-addressed)
- **Copy safety**: callers cannot corrupt stored values by mutating their byte slices

Values are written directly to the DB (not via batch) so `Get` works
before `SaveVersion`. Values are never garbage collected — dead values
after pruning are harmless noise.

### Full SHA256 (32 bytes)

No hash truncation. ICS23 natively supports `HashOp_SHA256`. This
avoids any need to fork the ICS23 library or define custom hash ops.
Proof sizes are slightly larger than a 20-byte hash would give, but
the simplicity and ICS23 compatibility are worth it.

### Mini merkle tree within each node

Each node's hash is the root of a binary merkle tree over all B=32
slots. This collapses the B+ tree into what ICS23 sees as a uniform
chain of binary `InnerOp`s — a single `InnerSpec` works for all levels.

Domain separation follows RFC 6962:
- **Leaf slot**: `SHA256(0x00 || varint(len(key)) || key || 0x20 || SHA256(value))`
- **Inner**: `SHA256(0x01 || left || right)`
- **Sentinel**: `SHA256(0x02)` for empty slots

The sentinel uses a **short-circuit rule**: if both children are the
sentinel, the result is the sentinel (not `SHA256(0x01 || sentinel || sentinel)`).
This ensures `EmptyChild` in the ICS23 spec works correctly at all
mini-merkle depths for non-membership proofs.

The leaf slot hash includes varint length prefixes to match ICS23's
`LengthOp_VAR_PROTO` exactly. Without this, proofs fail verification.

Mini merkle intermediates are **not serialized to disk** — only the
leaf-level hashes (childHashes/valueHashes) are persisted. The full
binary tree is cached in memory (`miniTree [2*B][32]byte`) and
recomputed on load (~31 SHA256 calls per node, ~1.9μs). Incremental
updates via `SetSlot` recompute only 5 hashes per slot change.

### No leaf sibling pointers

B+ trees traditionally link leaves for fast range scans. In an
immutable/COW tree, updating a sibling pointer on split requires
cloning the neighbor leaf and its entire ancestor path — a cascade
that doubles the write cost of every split.

Instead, both ascending and descending iteration use a **stack-based
traversal**: a stack of `(innerNode, childIndex)` pairs. When a leaf
is exhausted, pop the stack to find the parent, advance (or retreat)
the child index, and descend to the next leaf. The amortized cost is
O(1) node loads per leaf transition — the same as sibling pointers.

### 90/10 split for sequential keys

When the inserted key is larger than all existing keys in the leaf
(append pattern), the leaf splits asymmetrically: left gets B-1=31
keys, right gets 2 keys. Without this, sequential inserts produce
~50% fill (each left half freezes at 16/32). With 90/10 splits,
leaves stay ~97% full. Detection: `insertPos == B`.

For random inserts, the standard 50/50 split is used.

### Copy-on-write versioning

Every `Set`/`Remove` clones the root-to-leaf path. Unchanged subtrees
are shared between versions. `SaveVersion` assigns `NodeKey(version, nonce)`
to each dirty node and batch-writes them to the DB. The root reference
`R<version>` stores the root's NodeKey + hash (44 bytes).

If a version already exists with a different hash, `SaveVersion` returns
an error (matching IAVL behavior — prevents accidental overwrites).

`Rollback` discards COW'd nodes and reverts to the last saved snapshot.

### Pruning via dual-tree-walk

No orphan index. To prune version V, walk V's tree and V+1's tree
simultaneously. At each inner node, compare child hash **sets** (not
positions — children may shift due to splits/merges). Matching hashes
mean shared subtrees — skip. Unmatched hashes mean orphaned nodes —
delete recursively. Cost: O(changed nodes per version).

### Lazy node loading

`LoadVersion` loads only the root node from the DB. Children are loaded
on demand by `getChild`, which checks `childNodes[idx]`, and if nil,
loads from DB via the `ndb` reference stored on each `InnerNode`. The
10K-node LRU cache prevents repeated DB hits for hot inner nodes.

### ICS23 proof system

The `BptreeSpec` defines:
- `LeafOp`: prefix `0x00`, `PrehashValue=SHA256`, `Length=VAR_PROTO`
- `InnerSpec`: `ChildOrder=[0,1]`, prefix length 1 (`0x01`), `EmptyChild=SHA256(0x02)`
- `MinDepth=5` (at least one mini-merkle traversal), `MaxDepth=60`

Membership proofs: collect the path from root to leaf, then for each
node emit log₂(B)=5 `InnerOp`s from the mini merkle sibling path.
Total: 5 × tree_height InnerOps + 1 LeafOp.

Non-membership proofs: find the two adjacent keys bracketing the
missing key, produce existence proofs for both. ICS23's `IsLeftNeighbor`
verifies adjacency using the `EmptyChild` sentinel for boundary checks.

### Nil values rejected

`Set(key, nil)` returns an error, matching IAVL behavior. Use
`[]byte{}` for empty values.

### Store integration

`tm2/pkg/store/bptree` provides a `CommitStore` wrapper that satisfies
the same interfaces as `tm2/pkg/store/iavl`:
- `types.Store`, `types.CommitStore`, `types.Queryable`, `types.DepthEstimator`
- `StoreConstructor` is a drop-in replacement for `iavl.StoreConstructor`

The bptree proof decoder is registered alongside IAVL and simple merkle
in `DefaultProofRuntime` — both proof types coexist.

## Thread safety

The package advertises a tight but explicit concurrency contract. Code
that violates it is a data race, not a tolerated pattern. See Findings
#7, #9, #13 for the full history.

- **`MutableTree` is single-writer**. All mutating methods (`Set`,
  `Remove`, `SaveVersion`, `LoadVersion`, `Rollback`,
  `PruneVersionsTo`, `Import`) must be serialised externally. The
  implementation does not take a tree-level mutex; callers do.
- **`ImmutableTree` is safe for concurrent reads** so long as no
  mutator still holds a reference to any of its nodes. `GetImmutable`
  and `Snapshot` return trees whose roots are either freshly loaded
  from the DB (unshared) or explicitly cloned, so concurrent readers
  on the returned tree do not race with subsequent mutations on the
  originating `MutableTree`.
- **Iterators and proofs pin a version**. `GetImmutable` /
  `immutableForProof` register the tree as an active version reader;
  a concurrent `PruneVersionsTo` on that version returns
  `ErrActiveReaders` until every outstanding `ImmutableTree.Close`
  has run. Iterators obtained via `NewIteratorWithNDB` hold the same
  reservation and release it on `Close`.
- **Proof generation on a `MutableTree`** (`MutableTree.GetMembershipProof`,
  `MutableTree.GetNonMembershipProof`) goes through `immutableForProof`,
  which captures the current root without cloning. Concurrent
  mutations on the `MutableTree` while a proof is being constructed
  can tear the walked mini-merkle state, so the caller must ensure
  proof generation does not overlap with `Set` / `Remove` /
  `SaveVersion` on the same tree. Proof generation against a
  `GetImmutable`-returned snapshot is race-free.
- **`nodeDB`'s `batch` and `nextNonce` are single-writer**, protected
  only by the contract that `SaveVersion` and `PruneVersionsTo`
  never run concurrently on the same tree. An unwired `AsyncPruning`
  option was removed to prevent accidental activation; re-introducing
  a background pruner will require adding a save-path mutex covering
  these fields.

The `TestConcurrent_LazyLoadFromDB` test in `final_test.go` runs
ten concurrent `Has` calls against a lazily-loaded `ImmutableTree` and
is exercised under `-race` in CI.
