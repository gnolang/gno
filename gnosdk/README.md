# GnoSDK

GnoSDK is a toolkit designed to facilitate the creation of blockchains based on [Tendermint2 (`tm2`)](../tm2) and [GnoVM](../gnovm).
It provides developers with a set of tools, libraries, and utilities to simplify the process of building and running custom blockchain solutions.

## Disclaimer

**Please note that GnoSDK is not currently the primary focus of the project and will not be completed before the launch of the Gno.land main net.**
Our priority is to ensure the successful launch of Gno.land before dedicating resources to the development of GnoSDK.

However, GnoSDK exists in the repository to serve a specific purpose.
It helps us ensure that everything we develop in `tm2` and `gnovm` is not tightly coupled to [`gno.land`](,./gno.land).
It allows us to extract valuable components from Gno.land in the future and make them more generic.

Another use case for GnoSDK is to assist in working on `tm2` parts, such as multimode or performance, within a smaller context.
By having GnoSDK, we can focus on these specific areas without the need for the entire `gno.land` infrastructure.

Lastly, GnoSDK enables us to keep `gno.land` minimal while still providing a generic helper library.
This allows us to maintain a lean and efficient codebase while providing the necessary tools for developers to build their own blockchain solutions based on `tm2` and `gnovm`.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: GnoSDK seamlessly integrates with `tm2` and `gnovm`, allowing developers to leverage their capabilities while building their own blockchain networks.
- **Modularity**: GnoSDK follows a modular architecture, providing a collection of reusable components that can be easily customized and extended to meet specific requirements.
- **Blockchain Abstraction**: GnoSDK abstracts the complexities of blockchain development, providing high-level APIs and abstractions for common blockchain operations, such as transaction handling, consensus mechanisms, and state management.
- **Smart Contract Support**: GnoSDK includes tools and libraries for developing and deploying smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) with ease.
- **Documentation and Examples**: GnoSDK comes with comprehensive documentation and a rich set of examples to help developers understand its usage and get started quickly.
