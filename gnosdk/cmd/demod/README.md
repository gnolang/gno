# `demod` - Blockchain Node

`demod` is a lightweight blockchain node implementation built using the [GnoSDK](../..) toolkit.
It serves as a demonstration of how to create a blockchain network based on [`tm2`](../../../tm2) and [`gnovm`](../../../gnovm), showcasing the capabilities and features of the GnoSDK.

## Features

- **Consensus Mechanism**: implements a consensus mechanism based on proof-of-stake on Tendermint2 (BFT) for achieving network-wide agreement on the state of the blockchain.
- **Transaction Processing**: provides transaction processing capabilities, allowing users to create, sign, and submit transactions to the blockchain network.
- **Block Validation**: validates incoming blocks to ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain.
- **Network Communication**: communicates with other nodes in the network to propagate transactions and blocks, ensuring a synchronized blockchain state.
- **API Endpoints**: exposes a set of API endpoints for interacting with the blockchain, including querying blocks, transactions, and account balances.
