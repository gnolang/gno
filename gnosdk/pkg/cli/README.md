# GnoSDK CLI

The GnoSDK CLI Library is a collection of common [GnoSDK](../..) commands and utilities designed to be used by various CLI tools within the Gno (GnoVM/TM2) ecosystems.
It aims to provide a standardized and consistent interface for interacting with GnoSDK functionality, whether in the context of blockchain-specific tools or general-purpose CLI applications.

## Features

- **Command Definitions**: includes pre-defined command definitions for common GnoSDK operations, such as transaction submission, account management, blockchain querying, but also validator coordination, genesis manipulation, and more.
- **CLI Tool Integration**: is designed to be easily integrated into existing CLI tools, allowing developers to leverage the GnoSDK commands without having to reinvent the wheel.
- **Modularity and Extensibility**: follows a modular architecture, enabling developers to extend and customize the command definitions to suit their specific needs.
- **Consistent User Experience**: CLI tools within the Gno ecosystem can provide a consistent and familiar user experience, making it easier for users to interact with GnoSDK functionality.
