# Gno

At first, there was Bitcoin, out of entropy soup of the greater All.
Then, there was Ethereum, which was created in the likeness of Bitcoin,
but made Turing complete.

Among these were Tendermint and Cosmos to engineer robust PoS and IBC.
Then came Gno upon Cosmos and there spring forth Gnoland,
simulated by the Gnomes of the Greater Resistance.
