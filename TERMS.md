# Gno.land Network Interaction Terms

**Effective Date:** Upon first use of the Gno.land network.

These Network Interaction Terms ("Terms") govern any interaction you have with the Gno.land blockchain network (the "Network"), including sending transactions, publishing or executing code, and submitting any data or content to the Network. **By using the Network in any way, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Network.**

**1\. User Ownership of Content.** You retain ownership of any and all intellectual property rights you hold in the code, data, text, images, or other material that you submit to the Network or otherwise make available on-chain ("Your Content"). Nothing in these Terms transfers ownership of Your Content to any other party.

**2\. License to Operate On-Chain.** In order for the Network and its community to operate, and for others to use and build upon public blockchain data, you grant a license to Your Content as described here. By submitting any transaction on the Network, to the extent you have rights in Your Content and any resulting or derived on-chain state produced from your transaction ("Resulting State"), you grant to NewTendermint, LLC, GovDAO (in its capacity as the Network's governance body) and Network participants a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, store, reproduce, modify, transmit, publish, distribute, display, and create derivative works from Your Content and Resulting State, as necessary or useful to: (a) process your transactions and make Your Content available as part of the public blockchain state; (b) operate, verify, maintain, index, cache, mirror, archive, analyze, and provide access to the Network and its history; and (c) copy, reproduce, or continue the blockchain state (including Your Content and Resulting State) in connection with forks of the Network, and where the Network License applies to any portion of such content (for example, code and other copyrightable works), to do so in compliance with the Network License, including Strong Attribution.

**Forks and identity.** The Network may be copied or continued as a fork. "Qualified Fork" is a governance and identity status defined in the Gno.land Constitution. Nothing in these Terms grants any right to use the Gno, Tendermint, or Gno.land names or marks, or to represent any fork as the official continuation of Gno.land, except as permitted under applicable NewTendermint policies. On-chain data and state are public and may be copied and redistributed in practice. Where the Network License applies (for example, to code and other copyrightable works), Strong Attribution and other Network License requirements must be followed.

**3\. No Transfer of IP; Public Data Acknowledgment.** You acknowledge that the Network is a public and transparent blockchain and that all data submitted in transactions will be visible to the public and may be permanently recorded in on-chain state. Given this public and generally irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, you agree not to submit any content that you expect to be private or confidential. You understand that NewTendermint and most Network participants cannot delete, retract, or alter on-chain content once confirmed, and that on-chain data will likely be accessible indefinitely to anyone with access to the blockchain state. By using the Network, you are effectively publishing Your Content publicly and granting the rights described in these Terms to use it in a blockchain context.

**4\. User Representations and Prohibited Content.** You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights and authority to submit all content that you submit to the Network, and that by doing so you will not violate any law, contract, or the rights of any other party. In particular: (a) if Your Content includes code, you have the right to publish, execute, or upload that code and, if it is not your original code, it is under a license that allows you to use it on the Network; (b) if Your Content includes data, text, images, or other material, you either own that material or have obtained all necessary permissions to publish it on a public blockchain and to grant the license in Section 2; and (c) you are not prohibited from using the Network under any applicable sanctions or export control laws (for example, you are not on any government restricted-party list and are not in a country or region subject to comprehensive embargo).

You also agree not to use the Network to post or transmit malicious code, unlawful content, or content that violates the Gno.land Constitution or applicable community guidelines. You understand that the Network is decentralized and that on-chain content is generally not removable. Network participants, interfaces, and community governance processes may take steps to limit access to or visibility of certain content through particular interfaces or other measures within their control, but the decentralized nature of the Network may limit the ability to filter or fully remove on-chain data.

NewTendermint may block display of content via its interfaces to comply with law.

**5\. Open-Source Licensing of On-Chain Code (Network License).** Any code or other copyrightable work you publish for execution on the Network is made available under the GNO Network General Public License, version 6 (or any later version published by NewTendermint, LLC), including its Additional Terms on Strong Attribution (the "Network License"). If you operate or promote a user interface or service that incorporates or interacts with a Covered Work or Applicable Work under the Network License, you are responsible for complying with Strong Attribution.

If you publish code packages to the Network, you must also agree to the Gno.land Contributor License Agreement (CLA), and package publishing transactions are required to include the applicable CLA Hash as evidence of acceptance of the then-current CLA text. Package publishing transactions may be rejected by the Network if the included CLA Hash does not match the current canonical CLA Hash published by the Network.

**6\. Use at Your Own Risk; Disclaimers.** Using a public blockchain network like Gno.land is inherently at your own risk. The Network is decentralized and made available through independent participants (including validators and node operators). **NewTendermint provides certain Interfaces, but does not control the Network.** The Network and the Interfaces are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law. NewTendermint and Network participants do not guarantee that on-chain interactions will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. No fiduciary, advisory, or confidential relationship is created by your use of the Network or Interfaces. You are responsible for safeguarding your cryptographic keys, wallets, and assets. To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither NewTendermint nor any validator, developer, or contributor shall be liable for any losses or damages related to your use of the Network or Interfaces, or from the presence of Your Content on-chain. You understand that blockchain transactions are generally irreversible, and that software bugs, hacks, forks, or other issues could result in loss of data or assets. All use is at your own risk.

**7\. Continued Use Equals Agreement; Changes to Terms.** If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Network or submit any transactions. By using the Network (including by initiating any transaction or other on-chain interaction), you signify your agreement to these Network Interaction Terms. These Terms may be updated from time to time through a community-governed process or by NewTendermint, LLC in coordination with the Gno.land community. Material changes will be communicated via official channels. Your continued use of the Network after an update constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

**8\. Interfaces; Additional Terms.** NewTendermint and third parties may provide websites, software, and user interfaces that facilitate interaction with the Network. Your on-chain interactions are governed by these Network Interaction Terms. If you use NewTendermint-provided interfaces, additional terms of service may apply to those interfaces (the "Interface Terms of Service"), which will be linked from the interface and the footer when available. In the event of any conflict, these Network Interaction Terms control with respect to on-chain submissions and the license grants in these Terms, and the Interface Terms of Service control with respect to use of the interfaces themselves.
