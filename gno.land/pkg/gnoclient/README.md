# Gno.land Go Client

The Gno.land Go client is a dedicated library for interacting seamlessly with the Gno.land RPC API.
This library simplifies the process of querying or sending transactions to the Gno.land RPC API and interpreting the responses.

## Installation

Integrate this library into your Go project with the following command:

    go get github.com/gnolang/gno/gno.land/pkg/gnoclient

## Development Plan

The roadmap for the Gno.land Go client includes:

- **Initial Development:** Kickstart the development specifically for Gno.land. Subsequently, transition the generic functionalities to other modules like `tm2`, `gnovm`, `gnosdk`.
- **Integration:** Begin incorporating this library within various components such as `gno.land/cmd/*` and other external clients, including `gnoblog-client`, the Discord community faucet bot, and [GnoMobile](https://github.com/gnolang/gnomobile).
- **Enhancements:** Once the generic client establishes a robust foundation, we aim to utilize code generation for contracts. This will streamline the creation of type-safe, contract-specific clients.

## Usage

TODO: Documentation for usage is currently in development and will be available soon.
